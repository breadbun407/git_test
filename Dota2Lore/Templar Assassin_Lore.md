As a member of the Hidden Temple, Lanaya is closely associated with Inai, the  Void Spirit, whom she considers her master.
Yurnero had a romantic relationship with Lanaya, but the two apparently broke up after he did something to upset her. While Yurnero appears to have moved on, he still feels sadness. Lanaya feels jilted and has not gotten over the breakup. She is quite angry at Yurnero, to the extent of threatening violence, and attempting to make him jealous.
Lanaya has met other Ascended Ones aside from Grimstroke.
Lanaya's relationship with the Sunbreeze Family comes from her attempt to recover a certain artefact from Mireska's Father, who did not give it up easily. Although an assassin, Lanaya did not kill the elder Sunbreeze in this encounter.
