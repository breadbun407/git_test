The Father Mushroom is a mysterious entity in the lore of Dota 2.
Little is known about the Father Mushroom. He has an essence (which may be synonymous with spirit, implying that he is a living entity) that can be infused on clothes, possibly giving them a fungal appearance. Also, his essence was infused with the Shroom Thing, a treant-like construct made of fungus and moss.
Nature's Prophet owns a full set of equipment that's infused with the essence of the Father Mushroom.
