The Fabric of Creation is an important world structure of Dota 2.

It seems that the weave itself may be dangerous to the Weavers and others who are made of it, since they can be caught and entangled in their own weaves or its threads.

There are also other kinds of fabrics in existence that have no known corresponding threads. Because of this, it's unknown if they are actually part of the cosmic tapestry, but, they will be listed here just in case.

A number of entities keep the fabric safe and maintain it. Only three of them are known, the best known ones being the Weavers, followed by the Loom and the unnamed guardians.

Lastly, the mysterious guardians are a group of beings who protect the fabric. All we know about these guardians is that they have scissors which they use to purge rogue patches that pull against the fabric of creation that the Loom had woven, and then repair that gap in the fabric by reweaving itâ€“which was the case with Skitskurr and his attempt to create his own world. These guardians might be the personification of Fate that Weaver talks about, who also weaves threads together and cuts threads with a blade.

Because of his extra-dimensional existence, Darkterror the  Faceless Void can influence the very fabrics of reality, especially the fabric of spacetime.
Leshrac's  Pulse Nova manipulates the structure of spacetime with waves of pink and orange energy (possibly the Chronoptic energies), destroying lesser beings around him.
Rubick discovered a simple trick that allowed him to manipulate four-dimensional space in order to affect the happenings in his own.
Despite appearing as a brutish creature, the  Spirit Breaker is capable of bending aspects of nature to his iron will, a prowess that is  a combination of his cunning and strength.


The effect's of  Warlock's  Upheaval can manipulate space-time over a vast area, impairing entire armies.
Last but not least,  Weaver has many powers over the fabric of nature as both its keeper and its future destroyer to make room for his new fabric.

Cedric was an alchemist who crafted a pair of golden bracers capable of manipulating the spacetime fabric. After his dark conversion, it was taken by the Enigma.
According to the  Kidvoker, the  Blink Dagger can cut through space. Perhaps he means the space between the user and their destination is negated, hence it's cut.
Time and space bend before the winged  Boots of Travel to work its powers of nigh-omnipresence via teleportation that it grants to its wearer.
Weaver found a  Desolator just beyond the rift when he slipped through time. Its existence beyond time was shocking enough to be described as impossible.
