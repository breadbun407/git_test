Elementals are beings that are completely harmonious or at one with nature. This affinity allows them to control and call upon the many elements found in nature to their will, depending on what element they represent.
As previously stated, elementals are completely at one with nature. This means that they usually embody the aspect of nature that they represent: embodying the entirety of the element itself, borrowing aspects of nature into their form, or simply shaping their own body out of a specific element. This embodiment allows them to manipulate their respective elements to their will, and every power that they have focuses on their own elemental affinity.
Some elementals may have a liminal existence or the ability to planeshift, which means that they exist on more than one plane of existence or they can freely travel between planes, respectively. They usually exist on the material plane to embody their worldly elements and become physically observable in the forms that we see them in, but they also exist on another hidden plane that is ethereal or outright otherworldly. Notable planes of existence include the Astral Plane and the elemental realm.
Some elementals may serve a hidden master.

Spirit Breaker, also known as Barathrum, is an elemental being hailing from the elemental realm. He has borrowed the features of the bovian and simian creatures of the material plane to his physical avatar—an outward expression of his strength, agility, and cunning. Outside of his physical form, Barathrum is an elemental intelligence–meaning that his true form is actually a disembodied mind, much like the Ancients who are also classified as intelligences.
