The Dire Wolf is a species of wolf in the world of Dota 2.
They live in wolf dens in the Howling Weald as one of the few wildlife to not be scared off by the conflict between Lucius Longclaw and his canine clan versus Bogdugg and the Bonemeal Ogres.
Dire wolves are no different from other kinds of wolves, but what makes them unique is their ability to shoot out quills from their backs at high velocity.
The Longclaw clan consists of dire wolves as well. Together, they often attack Commander Targan's camp.
Remi, a gastromancer who aspires to join the White Orchids, says that the dire wolf's meat is very gamey. He also notes that their quills can be made into skewers for kebab dishes.
