The Trembling Isle is an island, surrounded by treacherous waters. It is either part of the Claddish nation, or an island nearby. Two historical battles occurred in the waters near the Trembling Isle.
A battle was fought between  Kunkka and an unnamed opponent. Kunkka emerged triumphant, and took the defeated captain's hat as a war trophy.
A great battle was fought nearby between Kunkka's Claddish Navy and the Demons of the Cataract. The Demon Fleet launched an all-out offensive on the Trembling Isle, forcing the Suicide-Mages of Cladd to perform a grand ritual, summoning ancestral spirits to even the odds. At the climax of the battle, however,  Tidehunter summoned the abyssal god Maelrawn, who destroyed both fleets in a storm of water, wind, and tentacles. What exactly transpired during this storm is unknown. In its aftermath, The Cataract, deserted by its demons, roared off into the void, while the Claddish Navy was reduced to but one ghostly ship, still under Kunkka's command.
Mireska was stowed away on Kunkka's ship during the fight, searching for trophies. She apparently altered the battle in a negative way for the Claddish navy, although she blames Tidehunter instead. Because of this, Kunkka is out to hunt her down.
