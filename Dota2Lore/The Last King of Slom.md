The Last King of Slom, whose name is unknown, grew increasingly eccentric towards the end of his kingdom. Surrounding himself with sorcerers and charlatans, his actions troubled the House of Ambry, a member of the landed caste of Slom. Sensing that something had to be done, Lord Ambry sent forth six thousand warriors to take the capital, but failed. What resulted instead was the Massacre of the Apostates, suggesting that the last King may have believed in some type of new religion. After this, the king had Lord Ambry executed, and his son Banehallow cursed with eternal lycanthropy.
The King was a collector of rare animals, which he kept in his royal menagerie. One day, a strange beast was brought before him, a beast that could speak, and did so to beg for its freedom. He refused, and sent the beast to live in the stocks, where it eventually died. The young  Beastmaster, then working in the royal menagerie, grew enraged at this, and decided to take revenge by setting free all the beasts in the king's collection. Freed and incited by  Inner Beast, the animals ran amok, and mauled the Last King of Slom to death.
Before his death, the king possessed one Mad Scepter, with which he used to strike the strange talking beast. It is not known what influence this scepter may have had on the king.
