The Emerald Abyss is a subterranean location, possibly near The Underhollow. It is a land of green crystals, geodes and bismuth formations, although statues made by some unknown race can also been found in the abyss. Mushroom and other fungi grow densely in the caves, which are home to pale axolotls.
Mushlings inhabit the abyss, where they hunt and eat beetles and axolotls. Giant drills are seen jutting out of the ground, possibly the work of Eimermoles. These drills are novel to the Mushlings, who have been seen worshipping them.
The Abyssal Horde, led by Vrogros, the  Underlord, fought a battle in the Emerald Abyss for supremacy over its middle ground. He claimed a prized emerald blade during this battle, which he now keeps in the obsidian city of Aziyog.
