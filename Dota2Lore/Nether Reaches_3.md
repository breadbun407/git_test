Regarding the former description, the Nether Reaches can be accessed by fissures in the earth that grant passage to the realm. This is no longer an option, however, since tectonic slippage has sealed the realm and its inhabitants from the surface world. There are vents in the Nether Reaches, but it's unknown what these vents allow passage for. Luminous caverns exist in this realm, which is home to the Netherdrakes.
