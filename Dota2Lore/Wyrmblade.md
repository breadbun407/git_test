Wyrmblade is the legendary sword of Sir Davion in the lore of Dota 2.
Little is known about Wyrmblade, besides it being Sir Davion's default sword. Although it can be assumed that Wyrmblade is a specially sharp sword for dragonslaying purposes.
Dragon Knight is the sole owner and wielder of Wyrmblade. Sir Davion only draws this sword once he engages in combat, only stowing it away once it has been blooded.
Alongside his off-hand shield of Slyrak, the Wyrmblade is his main weapon. He swears by this blade just as he swears to his shield.
