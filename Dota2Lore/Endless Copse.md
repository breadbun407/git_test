The Endless Copse is a location in the world of Dota 2.
As the name suggests, it is an oxymoron. A copse is a small group of trees packed together, but in this case it is said to be endless. At the heart of this paradoxical grove is the Candral-Flower, a flower that the  Nature's Prophet plucked out and wrapped on his staff.
