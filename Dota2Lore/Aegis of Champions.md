The Aegis of Champions is a physical trophy that is awarded to the winners of The International tournament. It was forged out of bronze and silver by Weta Workshop in 2012. The reverse side of the trophy is engraved with the names and handles of each player on the winning team of The International each year.

The Aegis was based on Norse and Chinese designs. Its central relief depicts lane creeps from the  Radiant and the  Dire.
