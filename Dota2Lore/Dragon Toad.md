Dragon Toads are a species of lizard-like creatures, with a spikey hide and the ability to spit globs of fire. Despite their name, they are not related to toads, but are distantly related to dragons. Dragon Toads may inhabit Nanarak and the Outlands. They eat meat, possibly among other things.
When born, dragon toads are no bigger than a fist, but grow rapidly. They have long lifespans.
