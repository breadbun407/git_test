Guttleslugs are giant, meat-eating worms. They inhabit marine environments, including inside Dark Reef prison, where they are known to devour prisoner's corpses. Guttleslugs are the size of a Slithereen, red and pinkish in color, with little spines on both sides of its back, and three prominent fangs around its mouth. Smaller slugs, possible young, are without spines, but still possess the three cutting fangs. According to the  Tome of Knowledge, Guttleslugs never stop growing.
