Omexe is a gladiatorial arena, likely located in the land of Druud. The centaur clans have gathered at Omexe for millennia to participate in deadly combat, and consider it a proving ground. Victory is determined by the last man standing. The champion is then awarded the Great Belt of Omexe, which symbolizes him as the greatest warrior of his kind. The blood sport is apparently limited to the centaur race, as it is uncertain whether any other races are allowed to participate.
