Bram is Davion's squire.
Bram is first seen assisting Davion getting his things to defeat a Dragon. they managed to follow them underground. Later the night Bram regales the people about what happened earlier claimed that he played a "Critical role". The next morning he alarmed Davion that Fruhling goes to hunt the dragon alone. And Davion sends his squire Bram to Dragon Hold to warn the Dragon Knights. and Bram did just that using his own blood in a town portal scroll.
Eventually, he would be unofficially promoted from squire to dragon knight by Kaden after an invasion of dragons in the dragon hold brought by Terrorblade.
In Season 2, he meets Auroth, as he was reading in a library in Icewrack. He was impressed with Aurothâ€™s poetry so much so that there appears to be a budding feeling between them. She also gives Bram a ring that can emit a barrier.
