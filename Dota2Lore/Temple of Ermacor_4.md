Only gargoyles exist within this place, attacking any adventurers who dare to encroach upon this place. However, they are not the only beings native to this temple. There are two large guardian statues standing beside the Grimwal Gate that will come to life when the gate has been activated. They still bear the blessings of Ermacor and have the ability to petrify anyone caught in their gaze.
