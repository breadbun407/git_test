The Moonblades refer to  Sange and  Yasha. It is said that Yasha takes on the form best suited to the wielder's martial art style, while Sange takes on its wielder's fighting style. Yasha is an unusually fast blade, and Sange seeks out the opponent's weak spots.
When combined and attuned by moonlight, the two blades grow even more powerful.
