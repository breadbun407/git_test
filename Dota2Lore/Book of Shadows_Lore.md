The Black Grimoire (also known as the Book of Shadows) is a massive arcane grimoire written by Demnok Lannik.
The weird Book of Shadows is said to be an impossible tome with pages filled with unreadable prose of unknowable thoughts. Filled to the brim with arcane knowledge accumulated throughout the years of Demnok's zealous thirst for lore, the book appears to be big and heavy relative to its author's size. The book is meant to preserve and instruct its info.
Arcane knowledge derived from recovering countless spellbooks are enwritten in its pages. Wukong and Hoodwink imply the Black Grimoire contains pages on demonology.
Those who are slain by its author will have their names catalogued in its pages. Compared to the grimoire's vast knowledge, its necrology is minuscule and insignificant.
The book is also a record of its author's life. Demnok embarking on a new feat becomes a new chapter in his book, and him succeeding in it becomes a story for his book.
Assuming that the grimoire is written by hand and not through writing machines or magical methods, the Black Grimoire probably contains Demnok's poor penmanship.
Warlock owns and wrote the Black Grimoire. It seems he carries it all the time (perhaps on his shoulder bag) since others talk about it as if it's on his person.
As one may tell from what is said about the book, the Book of Shadows is a reflection of Demnok's obsession to accumulate every last bit of arcane mystery.
The grimoire is his metaphor for his life. A new life after death is like turning a new page, but death is a page torn. Expanding it is a metaphor of him gaining knowledge.
With all the arcane knowledge preserved in it, Demnok intends for his Book of Shadows to last throughout the ages so that it may teach others who look upon its vast pages.
