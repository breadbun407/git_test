An incubus is a mysterious sort of demon in the lore of Dota 2.
Incubi are demons of Hell.
Not much is known about incubi in Dota 2, besides them being foul and having red skin. It may be assumed that they are the male equivalent of succubi.
Lion has claimed the skins of an incubus, wrapping it on his shoulders and his pauldrons as a symbol of his power over the Inferno.
Incubi are known to wander the terrene plane. They come here unbidden, implying that no one summons to this place, unlike most demons.
