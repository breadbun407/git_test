Chronite is a sort of mineral found at the edges between Claszureme and the normal realm. The ore exists in a stasis beyond time, and can infect and grow on living things when the exit this stasis. Chronite is used by Darkterror to forge his weapons and armor, which stabilizes his existence in the mortal realm, and warns him of impending attacks. A strike from a chronite stone is said to leave an eternity of pain.
