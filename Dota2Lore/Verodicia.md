Verodicia was a goddess in the Dota 2 world.
Verodicia was responsible for sowing the seeds of all greenery in the world, while also coaxing out the waters and sun to provide for them. However, she was on the verge of death before any of it could sprout. Not content to leave it unprotected, she swallowed one last seed that she had missed when sowing them, and died shortly after. After her body decomposed, the seed gave birth to Nature's Prophet, transferring all of her wisdom and power into him.
Verodicia also left behind a ring enchanted with her blessing.
Long ago, Verodicia left behind a sapphire gem in the wastes of a war-torn land, so it can help the land return to life again.  Nature's Prophet has found this gem, and now wears it between two butterfly wings.
