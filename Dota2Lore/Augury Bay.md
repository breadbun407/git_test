Augury Bay is a port city, and former home of Rizzrack. Judging by its similar name, it may have been located near the Vale of Augury. Its inhabitants were technologically advanced, likely made up of Keen, who constructed workshops to build great machines. Perhaps because of this reason, Augury Bay was attacked and destroyed by Treant Protectors, likely after it was discovered and categorized as a threat by Rooftrellen.
The city possessed walls and gates, but these defenses were not sufficient in repelling the Protectors. Prior to the attack, there was a flood, which may be unusual given the bay's "placid waves". Few survivors remain from the attack, one of which being Rizzrack, the  Timbersaw.
