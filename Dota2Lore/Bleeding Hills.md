The Bleeding Hills is a highland, located next to The Hoven. Black tar flows down from the hills, eventually collecting in pools in The Hoven.
The hills are home to hill trolls, a branch of the troll race. Rhasta was born in the Bleeding Hills. Their relative trolls reside nearby in The Hoven, where they make their homes in underground tunnels and caverns.
Hellwether rams are found in the Bleeding Hills.
