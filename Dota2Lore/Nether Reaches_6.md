In the Nether Reaches, the Arts of Oblivion are practiced by its inhabitants. There is a lamasery dedicated to the Arts of Oblivion, where young children are taught how to master its dark applications to become the next grandmaster of Oblivion. This brand of magic draws its power from the nether energies of this realm.
