Zaru'Kina was a human village in the Western Forests. It was the birthplace of Lyralei. On the date of her birth, a violent storm swept through the village, destroying everything in sight. Prior to its destruction, the people of Zaru'Kina was known to wear leather pads on their shoulders, and style their hair in topknots. They worshiped the sacred Gilded Falcon, and told stories of Angvols, mysterious flying beings that blessed them in battle.
