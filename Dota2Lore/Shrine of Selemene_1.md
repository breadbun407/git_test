The Shrine of Selemene is a holy site dedicated to Selemene, the lunar goddess. It is located in the Nightsilver Woods, and was built on the location where a celestial shard fell from the skies when the forest was still young. This shard may have been of an asteroid, perhaps of lunar origin. It was later crafted into a relic for the Dark Moon Order.
