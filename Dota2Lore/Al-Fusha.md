Al-Fusha was a character in the lore of Dota 2.
He was a great satyr general who once served the woods-goddess Verodicia in life. It is said that he died in battle and the wargear that he wore during his last battle was lost. Only his spiked and goddess-blessed pauldron was recovered, which is now being worn by Nature's Prophet in honor of him.
In life, Al-Fusha was dedicated to Verodicia, Goddess of the Woods. His spiked pauldron was blessed by the goddess herself.
Nature's Prophet respects Al-Fusha. He may have been the one who recovered the remaining piece of his wargear and wore it in honor of him.
