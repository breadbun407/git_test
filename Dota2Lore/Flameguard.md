Stationed in the Inner Colonnade, their purpose is to protect the Holy Flame at all costs. Unwavering in their devotion, the Flameguard are seen as embodiments of knightly duty. The Flameguard practice a particular style of fighting, with two-handed swords.
Their armor is adorned with the same blue hue of the Holy Flame, and each member wields a heavy, weighted sword. The sect's sigil is inscribed on their capes, with a circle representing the Inner Colonnade, and a triangle representing the Holy Flame. The Flameguard are led by commanders, who wear noticeably different armor and helmets.
