Prowlers are a race of beings resembling a cross between a Satyr and a Centaur in the world of Dota 2.
While not exactly implied, the Prowlers live in Roseleaf where they are neighbors with the treants and the Vhoul.
The Prowlers resemble the Centaur race with their humanoid upper torsos and quadruped lower torsos. What distinguishes the Prowlers from them are their heads which is that of a Satyr's and their clawed extremities rather than hooves.
They are a fairly smart species.
Among the Prowlers, the forest is an important abode to them. They are its protectors, and in turn they believe that the wilderness protects them. Prowlers believe in an unknown amount of gods, who bless the forest and its inhabitants. A religious people, the Prowlers see power in belief.
There are acolytes and shamans among the ranks of the Prowler race, which suggests that they have access to magic.
Farvhan the Dreamer is the only named member of this species. He is a Prowler Shaman and the leader of the Prowlers.
The Prowler Vanguard is a group that seems to specialize in devout protection.
Magnus trusted the Prowlers to protect a young child named Ilexa. They wordlessly adopted the child for they both knew what she was going to become when she grows up, and so they must keep her growth safe and unimpeded to realize her potential.
They stand alongside the protectors of Roseleaf, including the  Treant Protector and  Enchantress.
The Prowlers stand with Rix and the Vhoul's rebellion.
They seem to be on friendly terms with  Lycan and  Luna for unknown reasons.
As the protectors of their homeland Roseleaf Forest, the Prowlers reject the Marrowfell Hunters who prey upon its inhabitants.
The Prowler Vanguard protects Roseleaf from the presence of the Red Mist Horde and the Ancient factions.
