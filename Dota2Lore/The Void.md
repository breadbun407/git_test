The Void (also known as the Outer Dark or the Abyss) is a mysterious area frequently mentioned in the Outworld Destroyer's lore.
According to the description of  Astral Imprisonment, the Void is a "pocket" located between "this world" (likely the Terrene Plane or the unnamed planet housing the Ancients) and the Outworld. Anyone who gets trapped in this world by Harbinger is subject to the realization and contemplation of their inferior knowledge and vulnerability to death.
Even though the Void is a realm of inscrutable horror, it is merely a place of reflection and peace to the dark one who has mastered this ominous place.
The jagged crystalline Outworld can be found near this area, floating at the edge of this place.
