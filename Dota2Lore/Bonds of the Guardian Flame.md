The Bonds of the Guardian Flame are a set of teachings by Xin. For three generations, he taught these mantras to his pupils at the Fortress of Flares. The teachings invoked a series of mantras designed to train the mind and body for the harsh reality beyond the tranquility of the secluded fortress.
When Xin was slain in his declining years, there was no one left to teach the Bonds and its followers scattered to the winds of oblivion. But the ravages of time were not enough to erase his teachings. Xin's teachings endured the test of time through subtle whispers and deeds inspired by the Bonds' teachings. Touched by Xin's lasting legacy, the Burning Celestial reignited the ashes of Xin and his fiery image rose from the ashes to spread his teachings once more to a world almost bereft of it.
Xin sought to restore the mantras of the Guardian Flame beyond the Fortress of Flares and the Wailing Mountains. He set loose his  Fire Remnants into a passing storm in the hopes that he may find those who may still remember his teachings.
