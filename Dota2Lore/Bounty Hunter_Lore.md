While Gondar learned a great deal from Soruq, the master hunter also took a second disciple, whose name is unknown. Between the three, a sacred trust was forged. Yet, it was the second disciple who ultimately betrayed Soruq, stealing his secrets, and bringing them to an army of infidels. Angered by this, Gondar set aside his normal duties, and went on the hunt. Enlisting in the infidel army, Gondar tracked down the second disciple, and killed him. Then, using the traitor's own blade, Gondar assassinated the general of the infidel army, and brought the organization to an end.
