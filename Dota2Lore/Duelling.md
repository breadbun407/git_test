Duelling is a practice exclusive to the armies of Stonehall. Any soldier of Stonehall has the right to face any opponent in single combat, whether they have challenged an enemy of Stonehall or one of their own. The practice dates back to the days of ancient Stonehall, as stated in the Death Bounty document. In the early days, it was used as a way to solve disputes over two soldiers' bounties.
Mars claims to have invented the practice of duelling, so he may have been doing it before Stonehall and its forces did.
The previous Legion Commander before Tresdin challenged the able-bodied folk of Qine to a duel. If any of them could win, they would earn the title of Legion Commander from him. Among them was Tresdin, who was fifteen years old at the time. She didn't hesitate and defeated the Legion Commander and two Bronze Legion soldiers using the torn flagpole that the former was wielding. She wasn't awarded for her audacity and was beaten to near-death before being thrown into a pit.
Many years later, Tresdin rose above the ranks until she finally became a Legion Commander. During the battle of Roseleaf, Commander Tresdin challenged Sorla Khan to a one-on-one duel to end the war once and for all.
