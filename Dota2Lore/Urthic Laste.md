Urthic Laste was an official of ancient Stonehall's government. His title as the Lord Regent of Stonehall implies that he was acting on behalf of the real authority of Stonehall, which we know absolutely nothing about. On an unknown date in the past, he decreed the Death Bounty document in the Stonehall Cartularium, a text containing the proclamation of the Death Bounty tradition upon the armed forces of Stonehall. Because of this, he is credited for being a potential contributor to the martial tradition of Last Strike.
