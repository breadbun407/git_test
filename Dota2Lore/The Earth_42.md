According to former Valve writer Marc Laidlaw in an interview when he was asked about the world of Dota 2, he had hopes for Valve making something more novel than a “generic fantasy world with a traditional planetary sphere” for Dota 2's world. A scroll-shaped map and a Möbius strip map was considered, which the viewer could rotate and zoom in on to find out the names of different places related to each other in unexpected ways. He added that these maps can be rotated and stretched, causing the topography to change.
