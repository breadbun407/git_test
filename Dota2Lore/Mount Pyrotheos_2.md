Broodmother and her spiderlings were once revered by a cult near Mount Pyrotheos, who believed their insatiable hunger was divine. The cult constructed metal armor for her from the flames beneath Mount Pyrotheo's caldera. Worshipers would then offer that armor to Broodmother before throwing themselves into her webs to be devoured. The cult of spiders has since disappeared, leaving only pieces of armor scattered across Broodmother's endless webs.
