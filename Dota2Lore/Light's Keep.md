Light's Keep is a mysterious location in the lore of Dota 2.
Little is known about this Keep, as the only being that we hear this place from says little about it. Judging by this name, Light's Keep might be a heavily fortified place akin to a fortress or a castle. Apparently, the so-called "Light" that Ezalor keeps can be found here.
The Keeper of this place,  Keeper of the Light originates from this place to accomplish his noble quest. When he dies and his light gets snuffed out, he gets sent back to this place  to have his light restored and be restored to life once more.
The Light Brigade may be from this place. Ezalor often leaves them to pay for anything that he buys.
