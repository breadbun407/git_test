The Lesser Hells are one of the known layers of Hell in the world of Dota 2.
Little is known about the Lesser Hells, other than it having sixty-four planes where eternal damnation awaits as punishment for those who fail certain conditions.
As a place of the gnashing of teeth, one can hear a great wail of suffering and anger when accessing Hell, a horrible sound perhaps produced by the damned.
The Speed Demon, an imp courier with a brown hide, will suffer eternal damnation in the sixty-four planes of the Lesser Hells if he fails to deliver his masters' loot on time.
It's unknown if the Lesser Hells are part of the Seven Hells. It's also unknown if they are related to the Outer Hells.
