The Slithereen are an underwater race. Some members of the Slithereen race make up part of the Deep Ones. They are similar to the Naga.
The Slithereen have a humanoid upper body, with a fish-like lower body, and headfins on both sides. Some Slithereen possess bioluminescent lure-lights, dangling from their heads. Accustomed to the deep sea, Slithereen are sensitive to light. Nevertheless, they can surface and travel on land. Slithereen are also able to quickly grow back lost appendages.
Members of the Slithereen race form the Slithereen Guard, a unit of warriors tasked with defending the Deep Ones, as well as the sunken cities and its treasures. They have fought at the Battle of Stonefish Gate, as well as at Crey.
On occasion, the Slithereen will hunt Sea Dragons for sport, and use their body parts for armor and weapons.
The Slithereen refer to surface beings as "landlings".
Slithereen nobility wear large, jeweled crests on their head. Armor worn by commoners is usually light in color, and dark for Slithereen in exile.
Slithereen criminals are kept in the Dark Reef prison.
