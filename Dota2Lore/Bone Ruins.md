The Bone Ruins is an excavation site. A large triumphal arch used to stand at the entrance to the ruins, but was badly damage by explosives. Meepo owns the keys that opens the arch. Bandits have been known to live in the ruins, but were likely cleared out by Meepo. The skull of what appears to be a large bird has been found on the site, and is now used by Meepo as a piece of shoulder armor.
