Sorla Khan is an Oglodi. She replaced  Axe as the leader of the Red Mist army, and is known for being violent and unreasonable, even for an Oglodi.
Donte Panlin has battled Sorla before with unclear results. Yurnero is concerned about her actions, and wants to discuss a solution with Axe.
Sorla is currently hunting for  Axe, possibly for what he did earlier to the Red Mist Army. When she catches him, she plans to flay him.
