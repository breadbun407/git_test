The Chiseled Guard is an ancient and forgotten faction, whose members had long since passed away. Nothing is known about them, except that they were equipped with extremely heavy stone armor and weapons.  Sven has found one such suit of armor, and wears it on occasion.
Judging by Sven's other equipment, the Chiseled Guard may have been a lost sect of the Vigil Knights.
