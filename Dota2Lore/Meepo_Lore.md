Meepo once explored the Bone Ruins, where he obtained the key to the entrance arch, badly damaged by explosives. Inside, he found bandits, which he evicted, and took one of their bandanas as a souvenir. He also found the skull of a large bird-like creature, which he now uses to protect his right shoulder.
A clone of Meepo got separated and is now lost in The Underhollow. He is laden with mining equipment, and may have been looking for the rare Roshefort cheese. He has also grown a beard.
Meepo is familiar with the Jasper Circle, and apparently owes them a great unpaid debt. Because of this, he is hunted by Lorlin Lasan, who promises an ominous fate for Meepo once he finds him. He is also good friends with Mireska, a former candidate for the Jasper Circle, who goes drinking and gambling with him, and warns him about the Jasper Circle's plans.
