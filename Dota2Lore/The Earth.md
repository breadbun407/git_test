The Earth-like planet of Dota 2 is a major location.
The planet of Dota 2 is a huge rock with life on it.
Tectonic plates that continue to shift make the earth's surface and subterranean realms ever changing. Elder Titan credits Earthshaker as the “shaper” of Earth's continents.
When the planet was still being formed, it used to be a hot blob of matter before it cooled into what it is now. It was during this time its gravity tethered the Mad Moon to it.
The Omniscience's revelation to Purist says that it was the former who made this world by forming a vast mineral shell around itself to defend against extraterrestrial hostiles.
Earth orbits the sun like in real-life. Together with the moon, they complete the world's day and night cycle. But there are rare instances of moonless nights of intense darkness.
In Weeping Rose, there is no day and night cycle and only perpetual night reigns alone, allowing the Quorum to harness the power of the night sky's stars as much as they want.
First and only mentioned in Nature's Prophet's biography, the vernal equinox marks the very first morning or the beginning of the spring season.
The Earth-like planet of Dragon's Blood is pretty much like Dota 2's Earth which is, by extension, very much like real-life Earth.

High above the earth is the Ghastly Eyrie, a realm so lofty it's said to be among the clouds, the starry skies, in heights with no atmosphere, and even near outer space.
Many are the north's cold climes, akin to the Arctic. There's Icewrack, an icy waste where the Blueheart Glacier is. Azura and Cobalt are just a few of the north's settlements.
The west is home to several forests, such as the high woods beyond the Vale of Augury and the woods that house the village of Zaru'Kina. The drylands are western as well.
The southern reaches are akin to Antarctica; complete with bergs, floes, weak summers, and penguins like Whisky. A bit to the north is a waste that's home to a grand dragon.
A vast network of sunken cities lies deep in the lightless gulf of the deepest ocean abysses. This web of structures is a treasure trove that is fiercely guarded by vigilant Slithereen.
But further away beneath these sunken cities is the Infernal Hollow, from where the demon Buki'vak the Corrupted forever spreads his corruption throughout the sea.
The underground city of Aziyog lies deep in an endless cavern walled with obsidian, located beneath the magma fields and simmering roots of dormant volcanoes.
Named after the common beryl deposits found in these deep caves, the Emerald Abyss is a vast subterranean cave where many lifeforms dwell in.
The lofty cliffs of Emauracus are riddled with deep caves that lead to the center of the planet itself where the Omniscience dwells.
Far beneath the surface is the Nether Reaches, an abyssal realm sealed off by tectonic slippage, although vents near this place allow energies to seep out of it.
Most of the beings and entities listed below here are natives of the planet.

Born from the Nishian earth of the planet,  Earthshaker rises from the soil to answer the call to protect the earth with the life and strength it has given him.
Underlord lives in the obsidian city of Aziyog, located far beneath the magma fields and the roots of dormant volcanoes.
Viper the Netherdrake hails from the subterranean Nether Realm, which is implied to be located near the planet's tectonic plates.
The earth is the abode of the dead because it's where the living return to once they've had their time, making it vital in necromancy that involves controlling corpses.
Aktok is an ancient serpent god destined to swallow the entire world once he awakens from his dormant state.
The Omniscience dwells deep within a space in the center of the world, where it can be accessed through the deep caves of Emauracus.
Maelrawn is said to be the one who “cracked the shell of the world” by the Naga Siren. Perhaps his tentacles bore through the earth itself, but who knows?
As the goddess of the woods, Verodicia is the mother of everything that lives and grows on this massive fertile rock by feasting on the Sun's warm light.
The ancestral spirit of nature lies dormant within all plant life. Conduits of its power, such as Rooftrellen, can call upon it to animate his kin and cause an  Overgrowth.
These entities are alien to earth. They don't live here and they come from some other celestial body or another plane of existence before arriving on this planet.
As the  Arc Warden recovered from the reverberations of the Mad Moon's destruction, Zet made his way to our planet to catch up with his fugitives and their war.
Not only is the  Dark Seer lost from his home reality after traversing and locking the maze between the universal walls, but he is also trapped on this planet.
The comet of the  Morphling orbited this planet's sun due to the star's gravitational pull, until at last it fell to earth melted. Now, this alien is at one with this planet's oceans.
With bad news  Outworld Destroyer comes, drawn to this planet―the Ancients' battlefield―by a threat that he senses will stir from within reality just as it lurks from without.
The  Primal Beast was banished to our universe by would-be masters who failed to control him. Of all the places in creation, he was first sent to this planet in the Tomo'kan.
One of the cosmic travelers responsible for the death of Earthshaker's sister earth arrived on this earth to finish the job by killing the sister earth's power reincarnating in him.

The War of the Ancients is fought here on Earth and here alone because it is where the Nemesis Stones crashed to.

According to former Valve writer Marc Laidlaw in an interview when he was asked about the world of Dota 2, he had hopes for Valve making something more novel than a “generic fantasy world with a traditional planetary sphere” for Dota 2's world. A scroll-shaped map and a Möbius strip map was considered, which the viewer could rotate and zoom in on to find out the names of different places related to each other in unexpected ways. He added that these maps can be rotated and stretched, causing the topography to change.
But this idea was dropped in favor of the 2D map found in Source 1 because there were no people or time to work on such a complex idea. An additional problem was figuring out the coordinates where these regions would be placed in these complex maps. Although Laidlaw found the final one disappointing, he did find it easier to understand.
