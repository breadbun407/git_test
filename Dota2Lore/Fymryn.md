Fymryn is an Elf who was blessed by forgotten power. She wants to fullfill a prophecy to bring back Mene, the old goddess of the moon by stealing the magical lotuses from the pools of Selemene's temple, before handing them over to the Invoker, whom she believes will bring her back.
She possesses a unique magical power that revolves around agility and deception, well suited for an elusive being like herself and the race she belongs to. Fymryn has the ability to disguise herself into a different person, although this change only applies to her physical appearance and she still retains her true voice. She can also duplicate herself to summon up to fifteen identical clones, but they do not copy anything she is currently wielding. Lastly, she has the ability to teleport herself over short distances to make a quick escape or to overwhelm an opponent with quick attacks.
