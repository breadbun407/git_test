Sylak is the king of an unknown kingdom. He has a retinue of pyromancers at his service. The Nivan Gallants waged war on Sylak, possibly because they disagreed with his tyrannical rule. Sylak's pyromancers killed all the Gallants, except for the young Donte Panlin. His mentor Etienne Swiftguard passed his musket to Donte before he died, leaving him with a final message: "Fight fire with fire".
