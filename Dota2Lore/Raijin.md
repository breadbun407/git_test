Raijin was a Celestial. He was summoned without consent by the elementalist Thunderkeg, which angered him greatly. Because of this, he laid waste to Thunderkeg's land with winds and floods. The elementalist tried to resist this with his meager magics, and had little effect until he cast one suicidal spell that merged himself with the Celestial, bringing Raijin into his body and imprisoning him there. Now fused together into one being, the two were reborn as Raijin Thunderkeg, the  Storm Spirit.
