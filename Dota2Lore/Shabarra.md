God Emperor Shabarra is a character exclusive to the series of Dota: Dragon's Blood. He was the previous sovereign of the Helio Imperium. An aberration to the Divine Throne, he was only a God Emperor by name and possessed no divine power.
Viceroy Kashurra was his court advisor. He was very loyal to him, although this was just a sham that he maintained for many years.
Shabarra is the uncle of  Mirana. He arranged a conventional marriage with said cousin to gain power but this never came to fruition, as he was simply slain by an enraged Slyvion who dropped him to his death after he refused to give Davion the Eye of the Worldwyrm.
Luna, the Scourge of the Plains, is an enemy of the state because of her attacks against Helio Imperium troops.
