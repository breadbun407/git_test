The Suicide-Mages of Cladd are a sect of mages chiefly known for summoning ancestral spirits to protect the Claddish Navy during their battle with the Demons of the Cataract at the Trembling Isle. Like their name suggests, this was likely done through ritual suicide. The ancestral spirits gave the Claddish Navy a fighting chance, but may have disturbed the abyssal god Maelrawn, who appeared and destroyed both fleets in a storm. One of the ancestral spirits summoned by the Suicide-Mages may have found its way into Tidebringer, Kunkka's legendary sword, where it imbued the weapon with unique powers.
Since Kunkka is sometimes believed to be a phantom, it is possible that the Suicide-Mages' ritual caused him and his ship to survive in their ethereal forms after their destruction on the seas.
