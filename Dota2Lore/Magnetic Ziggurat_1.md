The Magnetic Ziggurat was the residence of Ptholopthales, the Vizier of Greed. It was built from lodestone on the slopes of Mount Pyrotheos, and held the vizier's "magnetic wealth". Thieves frequently attempt to enter the ziggurat, although many are killed by Black Arachnia in the process. After Ptholopthales refused to come to an agreement with Black Arachnia, he was killed and eaten. The Magnetic Ziggurat remains after his death, and continues to attract burglars.
