Mana is the essence of magic and life in the lore of Dota 2.
Mentions of mana in Dota 2's lore suggest that it's an ethereal and magical energy that comes from the soul, an energy drawn upon for magic. A few examples:

Mana can flow freely and thus is more abundant in environments with cold temperatures, creating mana-rich havens. It is said the source of mana is also the source of ice.
Pugna claims that all sorceries have their source in the Nether Reaches. Aether (a.k.a. void or nothingness) is an essential ingredient in magic, alongside this essence of magic.

Electromagnetism, a fundamental force of nature, has an effect on spiritual levels of existence. The  E.M.P. spell is proof, since its explosion of EM energy siphons mana.
Manipulation of the soul's Primordial harmony has an effect on the former's mana reservoir, depending on what is being done to this harmony. Here are two examples from Ezalor:

According to Aghanim,  Dazzle uses a mix of chakra and chaos magic, the latter of which is possibly akin to Ezalor's mana-restoring  Chakra Magic.
Ethreain the  Lich can forcefully  Sacrifice and consume the souls of others to restore his mana pool.
Inherited from his late demon partner's hand,  Lion can forcefully  Mana Drain the "life's force" of other magi to restore his own reservoir.
The  Invoker's  E.M.P. spell sparks a charge of electromagnetic energy that, as its fancier names suggest, siphons the mana of those caught in its detonation.
The  Keeper of the Light can both drain and restore the essence of magic, both applications possibly drawing upon the Primordial harmony.



Outworld Destroyer is a creature who is rich in magical power, which he converts into devastating force against anyone who crosses him.
Aghanim states that his spells cost loads of mana for him to cast. To be specific, it costs him at least 1,000,000 mana points to cast one of his spells.
The monks of Turstarkuri once had a peaceful technique that involved an unspecified manipulation of magic energy. Anti-Mage modified this to create his harmful  Mana Break.

The aptly-named  Soul Ring feasts on the soul of its wearer. In return, it provides them mana.
