Roshefort is a rare and valuable cheese, found only in the subterranean caverns of The Underhollow, below Roshan's lair. It is molded into wheels, and is highly sought after by heroes, adventurers, and Roshan himself, whose rampage in search of the cheese causes the tunnels to collapse below the ground. The Lost Meepo and various Eimermoles may also be searching Roshefort in The Underhollow.
