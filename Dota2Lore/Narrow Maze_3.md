The Narrow Maze is watched over by numerous guardians. The most well known is Razor, the Lightning Revenant. Hovering above the passages, he uses his electric whip to usher souls to the exits. He wears a mask, which has a map of the passageways written on the inside for him to see. Those who try to resist Razor and the other unnamed guardians of the Narrow Maze are cast into the "herebetween", a sort of limbo, in which they will wander forever with no afterlife to go to. Visage's Familiar is also known as one of the guardian watching over the maze.
