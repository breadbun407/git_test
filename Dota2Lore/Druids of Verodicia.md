The Druids of Verodicia are a mysterious faction of druids in the lore of Dota 2.
Little is known about them, besides them worshipping Verodicia and wearing coats of leaves as part of their uniform.
It is possible that they are the same men who dwell in the deep forest, are primal and driven by their instinct and a will to survive, and call upon nature's pantheon which is bereft in gentle gods.
These druids are dedicated to the woods-goddess Verodicia.
Nature's Prophet wears a coat of leaves in his default appearance that's also worn by this druidic faction.
