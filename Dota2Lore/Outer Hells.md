The Outer Hells are one of the known layers of Hell in the world of Dota 2.
Little is known about the Outer Hells, besides it being the home of the golem demons summoned by Warlock's  Chaotic Offerings. Warlock mentions the Outer Hells from where he summons his demons as “dark eternities” which implies its dark and eternal properties.
As a place of the gnashing of teeth, one can hear a great wail of suffering and anger when accessing Hell, a horrible sound perhaps produced by the damned.
Warlock's Golem is a demon spirit from the Outer Hells. Demnok summoned it into his Dreadwood staff, capturing it and binding it to his service.
Terrorblade is familiar with the demon slave of Demnok, implying he knows this evil demon spirit of the Outer Hells.
Almost as an afterthought,  Warlock summoned a demon spirit from the Outer Hells into his demonic Dreadwood staff.
It's unknown if the Outer Hells are part of the Seven Hells or not. It's also unknown if they are related to the Lesser Hells.
