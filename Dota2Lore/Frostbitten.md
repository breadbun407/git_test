The Frostbitten are an ancient race in the lore of Dota 2.
The Frostbitten are a time-displaced species from an unknown era. Today, they only dwell in the Frostbite Tundra, which may have gotten its name from them.



Due to their time-displaced nature, the Frostbitten possess an innate control over time. This manifests as a  Time Warp Aura that speeds up the spell cooldowns of nearby allies.
Counting gameplay spells, some Frostbitten seem to have ice magic in their arcane repertoire, such as  Freezing Blast,  Frost Armor, and  Icicle Spike. Their spells have no lore.
Some Frostbitten Shamans can be observed dancing together in a circle (with Witch Doctor's reused animations) within a ring of monoliths. It's unknown what this ritual is about.
Tusk once drove off a tribe of hungry Frostbitten when he saw them hunting down Remi.
