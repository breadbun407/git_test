Before time even began to flow, the four Fundamentals were once united in the Fundamental Plane where they were all bound to the great Primordial harmony created by the Elder Titan. When his hammer fell into the world, it caused a devastating effect on the early universe that split the Fundamental Plane open. The first Fundamental to escape was Ezalor, the  Keeper of the Light. The other Fundamentals followed suit, prompting the Chaos Knight to reunite his escaped siblings. He set his sights on the rogue Fundamental who escaped his respective realm, and it's only a matter of time and space before he comes for the other Fundamentals.
It is strongly hinted that "The Light" Chaos Knight has been trying to hunt down and extinguish is his own brother, Ezalor. He also seeks to hunt down the other escaped Fundamentals to reunite them in the Fundamental Plane.
According to  Omniknight, the Omniscience can see all of Chaos Knight, including versions of him from other planes. Omniknight is also hunted by Chaos Knight, whom he considers as his second target.
Chaos Knight is an enemy to the forces of Light, which include the now defunct Golden Lords who are also known as Children of Light. These beings, including their creation  Dawnbreaker, sought out the power of  Io to bind him. They failed to secure its power and were destroyed while their golem was left inert, leaving the Chaos Knight to continue his ancient pursuit.
