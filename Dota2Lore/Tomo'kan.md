Some shapeshifters (attuned to unknown animals, possibly werewolves given the context) come into the Wood Tomo'kan, but they don't reside in these woods permanently.
There is an unnamed death cult that conducts their activities, such as worship, in this woodland.
Abandoned outposts can be found here, suggesting the lost presence of Radiant or Dire forces in these woods.
