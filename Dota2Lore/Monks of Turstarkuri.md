The Monks of Turstarkuri was an ascetic faction that practiced deep meditation, following the teachings of Inai high in their mountain monastery at Turstarkuri. Because of their relation with Inai, the monks may be related to the Hidden Temple.
They shunned gods and magic, believing in peace and pragmatism instead. Meditating on silken cushions, the monks drank tea and nettles, and kept watch over the dogmatic scrolls of Turstarkuri. Little is known of their secrets, save that their techniques involved turning magic against their users, and that practitioners appear to have supernatural sight through a "mind's eye".
When Inai emerged from the Hidden Temple, he revealed that the monks had misunderstood his teachings, and were consumed by their own folly.
When the legions of the Dead God invaded the kingdoms below the mountains, the monks remained in meditation, believing that the invaders were merely demonic visions sent to distract them. After barely a fortnight, they were slain on the spot, and their bodies risen to join the ranks of the invaders. Only  Anti-Mage, then a young acolyte of the Turstarkuri, managed to escape with several of the monk's prized scrolls.
