As for the latter description, the Nether Reaches may not be a physical location, but rather a spiritual plane of existence. When targets are banished to the Nether Reaches, they will assume an ethereal form. There is also a ward that draws power from the Nether Reaches, and it exists between the corporeal plane and a spiritual realm, causing it to become half corporeal and half-ethereal. Items from the Nether Reaches can only appear in the material plane by tethering it to the said plane of existence. These pieces of info seem to contradict with the realm's status as a physical realm.
