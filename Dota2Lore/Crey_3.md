Crey was the place of a battle between the Slithereen Guard, led by Slithice, and an army of marauding Levianths, seeking to plunder its sunken treasures. Although the Levianth army was eventually driven off, a single chalice was found missing from the vaults of Crey, leading to Slithice being banished until it was recovered. The citizens of Crey, however were grateful for her services, and gifted her a piece of obsidian armor forged from the fires of an underwater volcano.
