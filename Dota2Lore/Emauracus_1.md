Emauracus is a place in the Dota 2 world, known for its cavernous cliffs. The priests of the Omniscience dwell in these caves, which lead deep into the earth, where the Omniscience resides. A journey to the Omniscience can take many weeks. Sacrificial pits to the Omniscience can also be found, although it is unknown whether these pits are natural, or man-made. The high cliffs of Emauracus is symbolized by a pair of wings, sometimes found on armor and equipment.
