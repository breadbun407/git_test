Emauracus is a place in the Dota 2 world, known for its cavernous cliffs. The priests of the Omniscience dwell in these caves, which lead deep into the earth, where the Omniscience resides. A journey to the Omniscience can take many weeks. Sacrificial pits to the Omniscience can also be found, although it is unknown whether these pits are natural, or man-made. The high cliffs of Emauracus is symbolized by a pair of wings, sometimes found on armor and equipment.
Powerful relics, like the Adoring Wingfall hammer, are kept in the vaults of Emauracus. The forgemaster of Emauracus claims he is the best smith alive, but even he is amazed by the armors forged by the first knights who received the Omniscience's blessing.
