The Overgrown Empire was a civilization that flourished inside the jungles of Fellstrath. Its people worshiped the Mo'rokai, a pair of mythical, four-legged beasts with magical powers. Temples to the Mo'rokai can be found in the empire's former lands, its ruins stilled guarded by stone statues, now reanimated by the Ancients. Stone sentinels in the shape of glaring totems stood watch over the empire, and can still be found today. After the civilization fell, the Mo'rokai they worshiped went dormant.
