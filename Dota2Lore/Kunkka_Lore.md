Kunkka is the former admiral of the Claddish Navy. He comes from a line of seamen, who once hunted whales with harpoons. A veteran commander, he was present in the battle of Port Mignin, as well as the first and second battle of Trembling Isle. He wields the legendary Tidebringer, a sword inhabited by a lost Claddish soul.
After the second battle Trembling Isle, Kunkka washed up on a Keenish shore, where he resumed his career as a fleet commander, with Keen as crew. Rumor is, he compelled Keen artisans to craft him a new sword from the salvage of Cataract Demons, who had also washed up on the same shore. The Keen apparently hold him in high regard, giving him the keys to the gates of their capital. At least one ship under his new command is known by name, the Majestic Leviathan, a great vessel carrying countless chests of treasure.
Another unconfirmed rumor is that Kunkka parted the seas with his Neptunian Sabre, found Maelrawn, and sliced off one of the god's tentacles.
While Kunkka does not appear to be a pirate, he does have a habit of looting precious objects when the opportunity presents itself. His Admiral persona is merely a disguise, his true identity is the dreaded Brownbeard the Brave one of the most feared pirates in the sea.
As a young man, Kunkka served as a midshipman. He was ambitious, seeking to climb up the ranks. During his early days, he heard tales of great sharks, longer than a frigate, that hunted ships and devoured sailors. As he grew older and rose in rank, he earned the gold-laced buttons that indicated his new status. As an adult, he hunted and killed the giant sharks he heard about as a young man, confirming that such legends were true.
