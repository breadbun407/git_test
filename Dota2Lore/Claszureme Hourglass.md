The Claszureme Hourglass is an hourglass with mystical properties, linked to the realm of Claszureme and the god Clasz. It formerly belonged to Darkterror, but was stolen by Mireska. The hourglass is capable of producing an effect on time when turned over, and Mireska hints that should Darkterror ever find out that it has been stolen, all she would have to do is turn the hourglass over.
