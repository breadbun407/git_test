In the days of old, worshippers of Ermacor would often go on a pilgrimage through the Silkmire Pass (long before it was infested) to visit the temple and pray. Nowadays, the temple has been left abandoned and the road leading to this place has become infested by Ankaboot's brood. It is unknown if the spiders settled on the road after it was abandoned or if they were the reason for its abandonment. The temple is filled to the brim with many deadly traps.
