The Demons of the Cataract are a faction of demons that organized to invade the lands of man, particularly Cladd. Inhabiting on or around The Cataract, they began a series of increasingly aggressive assaults on the islands of Cladd. Opposed by the mighty Claddish Navy, the Demon Fleet clashed with admiral  Kunkka's fleet at the Trembling Isle, where they were held off by the ancestral spirits of Cladd, summoned by Suicide-Mages. In the heat of battle, however,  Tidehunter summoned the abyssal god Maelrawn, who destroyed both sides in a violent storm.
The Demon Fleet was known for employing "carnivorous" ships, although no further descriptions have been found. Following the battle, Kunkka had a cloak made for him from the skin of a Cataract Demon.
