The Lost Order was an ancient school of swordsmanship that existed before the apex of the Isle of Masks. Its real name is unknown. The school kept extensive records of their practices on parchments in several libraries. Eventually, the swordsmen of the Lost Order discovered techniques that allowed them to cut through the fabric of reality with their blades. Fearing the implications of such actions, and the consequences they might bring, the elders of the school burnt all the records in their libraries, and killed every last one of the school's followers. When this was done, they committed suicide, so that the knowledge of rending reality would never be known.
