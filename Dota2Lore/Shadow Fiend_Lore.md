In the story of Artifact, Nevermore was the only member present to speak for the Court of Ristul. A desperate Vhoul commander named Rix approached him and asked for power that would allow him to gain a great advantage in their struggle as they were already losing the war against the Bronze Legion. A deal was struck between them and Rix's soul was claimed by Nevermore, turning him into a demonic version of himself, followed by his dead Vhoul comrades in Roseleaf being reanimated into the world of matter.
Nevermore also has a flock of disciples who resemble his demonic genielike form. Just like their master, these followers carry out his work in striking deals with mortals, usually finding such work in places with conflict and desperation.
