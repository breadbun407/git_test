Besides the core of Nature being a world of torment and decay, it is said by Leshrac to be a blasted world, meaning that it's a nature destroyed and damaged. Despite its evilness, it's substantial to the existence of this universe, since it is called the “core of the universe” or the “fundament of nature” to Enigma, the latter name implying that this foul plane is the very foundation of all creation which supports its existence—a starting point for creation from where all things in nature are formed from.
