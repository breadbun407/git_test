Nortrom is the warden of the Tyler Estate, working alongside the Anti-Mage with the common goal of policing the usage of magic. He is pleased to work with the Anti-Mage, likely due to their similar anti-magic abilities. Despite this, they have different methods in dealing with sorcerers: Nortrom prefers them to be imprisoned then drained of their magical capabilities, while Anti-Mage would rather kill them instead.
