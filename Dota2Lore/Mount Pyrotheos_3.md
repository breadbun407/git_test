Knowing that Black Arachnia's presence discouraged intruders, Ptholopthales came to Mount Pyrotheos, and built his Magnetic Ziggurat on the slopes of the volcano. This attracted an endless number of thiefs, all of which were consumed by Black Arachnia. However, the intruders posed a danger to her young. Black Arachnia paid a visit to Ptholopthales, who refused to discuss a compromise to lessen the number of intruders. Angered, Black Arachnia wrapped the vizier in a silken cocoon, and ate him. Unfortunately, this did not stop the continuous stream of thieves, and thus Broodmother has set out to hunt down any potential intruders before they set foot near her tunnels.
