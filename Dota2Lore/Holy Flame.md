The Holy Flame is an artifact kept by the Vigil Knights at the Inner Colonnade. It is a blue, ever-burning fire, protected by the Flameguard, a highly skilled sect of the Vigil Knights. The Holy Flame is symbolized by an inverted triangle.
Nothing further is known about the flame, save that it was used by  Sven to burn the order's Vigil Codex.
