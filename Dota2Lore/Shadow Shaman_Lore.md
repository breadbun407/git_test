Like the other shamans of his day, Rhasta traveled from town to town, peddling his services to all manners of peoples. But by near the end of the Sordid Era, the reputation of it inerant shamans had fallen into disrepute. Magicians like Rhasta were blamed for diseases and poor harvests, leading to their persecution and execution. Fearing for his life, Rhasta hid his shamanic powers, disguising himself as a vagabond, while performing the same services the old con-man once had. Should anyone ask about his skills, he claimed he had merely learned them on the road as a wanderer. His master's advice stayed with him, and he wore a wide-brimmed hat, as well as banners on his back that clearly displayed the services he offered, in case of any confusion that may lead to hostilities with distrustful villagers. While on the road, he brewed a potent drink, which he kept in a bottle by his side, toxic to everyone except himself.
Rhasta's enemies piled up as he killed his pursuers, attracting even more powerful foes to seek him out. To avoid this, he went into hiding below the earth, but did not find sanctuary there either. Instead, he was met by Gliss, a lordly serpent priest who desired his powers, and tried to attack him with a cursed decanter. Rhasta had no choice but to kill Gliss, and later acquired the priest's censer for himself.
