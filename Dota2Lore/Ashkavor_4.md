Grimstroke was the last Ashkavorian to ascend. In his greed for power, he contaminated the ritual inkpots with a strange ichor. When he dipped his brush, the ink swirled up towards his body, engulfing him entirely in blackness. As an act of desperation, he pushed the corrupted ink into the bonds he had made with his fellow Ashkavorians, instantly transforming all of his kin into cursed shades. This calamity ended Ashkavor as a civilization. Grimstroke fled from the city, only to return later, finding it still and lifeless. A magic brush, made with magic from the ancestral bloodlines of Ashkavor, was kept in the city until it was taken by Grimstroke upon his return.
