Gargoyles are a type of elemental in the world of Dota 2.
There are gargoyles that can be found in Nishai, the abandoned Temple of Ermacor, and the Narrow Maze.
Gargoyles are sculptures of grotesque and fearsome looking beasts carved from stone by sculptors or artisans. Hence, they are earth elementals like the golems.
They are distinguished from motionless statues by their ability to switch between an animated state, despite their stone bodies, and their more natural  Stone Form.
Of ghost and stone, the dreaded gargoyle  Visage is the bound form of the eternal spirit Necro'lic, forever hunting fugitive souls who have escaped the afterlife to live again.
The blind, sneering  Familiars perched atop the Narrow Maze's entrance are the gargoyle guardians of that maze, looking down upon all who decide their final afterlife.
Before  Earthshaker assumed a mortal bovine form to roam far from Nishai, he once had gargoyle friends in that land, whom he still misses dearly.
One of the  Juggernaut's  Healing Wards is a jade gargoyle carved by the Kuur-Ishiminari craft-clan. It has witnessed many profane and glorious deeds.
Tiny speculates that the small chunk of stone that he came to life in could be a shard swept from a gargoyle-sculptor's workshop.
The eternal spirit Necro'lic is the master and owner of Visage, who is its bound form. Being the master of Visage, he is the master of its gargoyles as well.
Ever motionless in their jade form, the Kuur-Ishiminari's gargoyles have seen many profane and glorious deeds, never intervening as they merely watch with unblinking eyes.
