The Wyrmforge was likely a location or a group that is related to the arts of forging and smithing. Few of its creations remain, and even fewer are its members, but all that remains of it is a figurehead of two dragons removed from its mast, which is now in the Elder Titan's possession. The Fallen Sky weapon also originates from the Wyrmforge, a powerful weapon created by the acolytes of the Wyrmforge.
