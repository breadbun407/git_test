Broodmother and her spiderlings were once revered by a cult near Mount Pyrotheos, who believed their insatiable hunger was divine. The cult constructed metal armor for her from the flames beneath Mount Pyrotheo's caldera. Worshipers would then offer that armor to Broodmother before throwing themselves into her webs to be devoured. The cult of spiders has since disappeared, leaving only pieces of armor scattered across Broodmother's endless webs.
Once, an unnamed blacksmith wandered into Black Arachnia's lair. Fearing for his life, he begged the Broodmother to spare him, and in return, he would craft her a set of armor. Black Arachnia agreed, and the blacksmith set about, measuring and forging a new set of spider armor, using metal collected from the discarded armor of knights who had fallen prey to the Broodmother. He completed eight spiked leg guards, each fashioned from the breastplate of a fallen knight. Then, with trembling hands, the blacksmith laid a metal headpiece on Black Arachnia's head, saying "A crown fit for a queen". Satisfied, Black Arachnia upheld her promise, and set the blacksmith freeâ€“only to watch him be eaten alive by her spiderlings.
Black Arachnia once knew Sun Wukong, and apparently had a friendly relationship. They "broke up" eventually, and remain hostile to each other to this day.
