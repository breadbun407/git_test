Mireska's Father is one of the merchant kings of Revtel, and the head of the Sunbreeze Family. His name is unknown. He is extremely wealthy, but a little overbearing to his daughter Mireska. Like other members of the Sunbreeze family, Mireska's father is known for being disagreeable.
He desires to find the Hidden Temple, spending much of his wealth on its search, but to no avail.
Having left the city after burning down her family's estate, Mireska is now sought by her father, who may have hired Gondar to find her.
Lanaya, the  Templar Assassin once recovered a certain artefact from Mireska's Father, who did not give it up easily. Although an assassin, Lanaya did not kill the elder Sunbreeze in this encounter.
