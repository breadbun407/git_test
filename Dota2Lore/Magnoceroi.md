The Magnoceroi (singular: Magnoceros) are a race of furry quadrupeds, with a prominent single horn. They lived around Mount Joerlak until its eruption, after which they headed north to find refuge. According to the master-smiths of Mount Joerlak, Magnoceroi horns are more precious than any alloy. This led the Magnoceroi to frequent and bloody encounters with hunters.
Magnoceroi are notoriously stubborn, and do not believe in chance. Their culture is matriarchal. One day, the Magnoceroi intend to kill those responsible for the Mount Joerlak's eruption, and reclaim their homeland. In battle, the Magnoceroi gore enemies with their horns, trample them under hooves, and run them through with pikes.
An unnamed Magnoceros aided the Dreadknight in attempting to conquest Ostarion's kingdom, but failed. After his death, his skull was made into a pauldron.
