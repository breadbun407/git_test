Demons are a loosely defined race of beings in Dota 2 lore. They inhabit the Seven Hells and a number of subterranean realms, such as the Abysm or Foulfell. Most demons speak the language of Ozkavosh. They are ruled by the Demon Lords. Demon outlaws are imprisoned in the hidden dimension of Foulfell.
Demons are very egotistical, selfish, and self-centered. They lack a conscience and are more than willing to betray others or their own kind to satisfy their needs.
According to the likes of Void Spirit and Dawnbreaker, demons are creatures of great power and limited intelligence.
