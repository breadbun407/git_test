The Font of Avernus or Avernal Font is a source of mystical vapors that grants powers to its guardians, the House Avernus. It flows from a crack in the stone, and breathed in by members of the House. The vapors resemble a black mist that absorbs light, and imbues strange powers over life and death. Those attuned to its energies can also see fortunes and fates in the mist, revealing secrets of lordship, war-making, and dominance. For this reason, the powers of the Font are hated even by the immortal demons of hell.
