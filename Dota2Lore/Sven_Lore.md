Sven is a rogue knight, half-Meranth by birth. After his father was executed for violating the Vigil Codex, Sven's mother passed away, leaving him an orphan. Tightly bound to his own personal code of honor, Sven is a solitary warrior who wields the legendary Outcast Blade to devastating effect. He travels alone, searching for honor and glory, while acquiring substantial gold as a freelance swordsman.
Wielding the Adjudicator's Blade, Sven cracked  Juggernaut's mask, releasing the spirits of Yurnero's ancestors, as well as a companion dragon spirit. The spirits and Yurnero both consider this an act of kindness, and are thankful for Sven's actions, and owe Sven a debt of gratitude.
Sven holds those in solitude in high regard, such as the  Lone Druid, but he does not necessarily ally himself with them to stay true to his code.
Crystal Maiden appears to have affection for Sven, addressing and complimenting him personally.
In this strange timeline, the story of Sven has reached the point where he is still aligned with the Vigil Knights, but their sudden destruction from within is a future that cannot be avoided, at least to the will of the Rogue Knight. To assure that this possibility comes to fruition, Sven must train among his enemies, rise above their ranks, and ultimately: destroy them from within.
Although he has not enacted his rogue code yet, he manifests a bit of the code in his actions by aligning against any kind of army like any true rogue to society would. He has declared war against the Radiant and the Dire,  Venomancer and his expanding garden of  Plague Wards (which Lesale calls as his "children"), the Bronze Legion, the reformed Red Mist Horde, and even the Vhoul rebellion.
