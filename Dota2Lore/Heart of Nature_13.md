It is interesting to notice that there seems to be no intelligences native to this plane. The only intelligences here are those that are non-native lifeforms, but rather, visitors like Leshrac (although he, and perhaps all of creation, technically belongs here). Maybe the lack of native sapient beings has something to do with the plane having witless elements, with "witless" possibly meaning that they lack a mind. If there were any native intelligences here, then Leshrac would not have called this place a cloister. But this isn't the case, implying that he's the only creature here.
