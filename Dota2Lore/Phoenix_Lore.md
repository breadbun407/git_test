Phoenix was responsible for bringing  Dawnbreaker back to life after the spark within her was destroyed by Io. When Phoenix soared across the cosmos, his spark passed by the solar forge that contained her life essence, reigniting the spark of Dawnbreaker.
Phoenix once had the relics Solar Forge and the Solar Gyre in his possession. Lost from him in some point in time, he later recovered the first relic, but the second one was dug up and found by Mortimer,  Snapfire's dragon toad friend. Snapfire then traded it away to Phoenix, who was said to be "surprisingly shrewd".
