The Crimson Cut-throat was a notorious assassin. He made no demands, and had no agenda. His contracts were paid, paradoxically, by the families of his victims. Carrying a shield, the Crimson Cut-throat wore red armor, and owned a large array of ornate blades and daggers.
Gondar eventually tracked down and killed the Crimson Cut-throat, taking his blades and armor off the corpse as a souvenirs. Of all the contracts Gondar had accepted, he considered this kill the most difficult.
