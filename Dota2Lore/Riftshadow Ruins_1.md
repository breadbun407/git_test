The Riftshadow Ruins is the site of a former civilization. It is valued for its historical sculptures and artifacts. A large palace once stood on the site, where dark rituals were practiced on live victims. Those who survived the rituals had their souls placed in a crystal, and shattered to pieces. These crystals can now be found in the ruins, and are referred to as Riftshadow Crystals. At least one town is near the Riftshadow Ruins.
