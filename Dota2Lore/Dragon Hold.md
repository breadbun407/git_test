Dragon Hold is the home of the Dragon Knights
Davion tells a young boy to take a dragon fang to Dragon hold where he will take the test. Later Davion sent Bram there to inform about Fruhling's activities. Later it takes days to travel and serves as a pit-stop for Mirana and Davion in order to reach their destination. Kaden later faced Slyrak at Dragon Hold.
After the battle at the forests, Davion was taken in by Kaden, bound in chains to Dragon Hold and kept him prisoner.
