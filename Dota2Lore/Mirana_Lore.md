Mirana was once besieged and forced to defend her dying mount. Exhausted and at the verge of collapse, her struggle was seen by the Selemene's former mount, the heavenly Axia of Metira, who descended from the skies to carry Mirana away. It is unknown whether or not Mirana's dying mount refers to Sagan.
Mirana is first introduced alongside Marci. The duo searched for Selemene's Lotuses. And she ran into Dragon Knight during his celebrations at the tavern. Davion grew interested in her and later accompanied them from Haupstadt to the Dragon Hold. Later she ascended into the Solar Throne as the Empress of the Sun.
