Meranths, also known as Mer, are inhabitants of the seas, likely comprising of Slithereen, Naga, Levianths, and others. The Meranth are spread out across a diaspora, whose tribes are constantly at war over territory. Meranth politics are complex and opaque to the surface world, although they do maintain treaties with the nations of man.
Sven is half-Meranth, as his mother was a "Pallid Meranth". It is unknown what distinction this entails, but is assumed to give a hint of a yet to be revealed meranic "wild race", according to the Vigil Knights. Given Sven's place of upbringing, his mothers race may be common to the Shadeshore Ruins.
Meranth mythology looks to the moon and stars for wisdom and guidance.
Meranth criminals are kept in the Dark Reef prison.
