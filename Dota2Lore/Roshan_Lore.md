Roshan the Immortal is a powerful being.
Located just beneath Roshan's lair, The Underhollow is a series of maze-like rooms where the rare Roshefort cheese is found. Upon hearing of this cheese, Roshan joined heroes and adventurers in The Underhollow in search of the Roshefort, causing collapses and cave-ins. After reading about the tunnels in the  Tome of Knowledge, Lyralei assumes that the entrance is caved in, which was likely caused by Roshan and the adventuring heroes.
