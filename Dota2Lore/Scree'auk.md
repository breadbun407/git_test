Scree'auk is a goddess who granted Shendelzare the spirit energy she desired to exact her revenge. She may be sacred to the Skywrath race, and likely resembles a large bird.
Dragonus may have made a pact with Scree'auk, trading his loyalty to her in exchange for power. He may have also had the Scree'auk's Talon made for his unrequited lover, Shendelzare.
