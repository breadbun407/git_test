Kraken Tortoises are a species in Dota 2, characterized by its tough shell, which is used as armor or shelter. They are a fierce animal to hunt, but also a sought-after delicacy.  Tidehunter often sports a Kraken Tortoise shell on his back. It is unknown what relation, if any, the tortoises have with Krakens.
