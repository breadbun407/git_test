Mount Joerlak is a volcanic mountain, known for the master-smiths that dwell on it. For reasons unknown, it erupted one day, killing many of the Magnoceroi living in its vicinity.  Magnus believes this explosion was intentionally caused, not naturally occurring. An unstable mountain, Magnus is able to channel its subterranean vibrations.
