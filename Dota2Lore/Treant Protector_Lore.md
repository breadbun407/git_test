Rooftrellen is the only member of the Treant Protectors known by name. Like the others of his race, he is long lived, and time appears to pass quickly for him. Being the only protector to ever leave their homeland, Rooftrellen is confounded by gold and items, objects he has never before seen. Like other protectors, Rooftrellen fears heroes who wield axes and fire.
On his forehead, Rooftrellen wears a special runestone. What this signifies is unknown. Whether or not the Treant Protectors are related to  Nature's Prophet's treants is also unknown. Rooftrellen can summon the Spirit of Nature to release its power, causing an  Overgrowth of vines and roots. It is unknown whether this ability is unique to him, or available to all protectors. If Rooftrellen were to fall in battle, a seedling will sprout from his body, grow into a second protector, and continue his mission.
It is likely that the city of Augury Bay was scouted out by Rooftrellen, because it was soon attacked by an army of "walking trees". Given geographical closeness and Rizzrack's account of the attack, these trees strongly resemble the Treant Protectors. For this reason, Rooftrellen has a natural rivalry with  Timbersaw.
Rooftrellen has been to Roseleaf, where he accomplished a great deed. He has since left, however, and Mireska regards his leaving as a mistake.
Rooftrellen is unusually hardy, providing a sanctuary for stuntwood sproutlings, a parasitic plant that otherwise kills most trees.
