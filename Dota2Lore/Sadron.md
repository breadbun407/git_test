Sadron is a character in the lore of Dota 2.
It was Sadron who must've made the  Cold Snap spell or was involved in its creation since their possessive name is invoked when others cast it. Thus Sadron might be a mage.
Seeing how the young Invoker (who existed during the earliest days when spell-casting was once at its most potent form because 'twas still primarily a mnemonic art) learned this Cold Snap spell alongside his nine other invocations, Sadron must have existed during this golden age of magic as well and thus this obscure mage must've been an ancient one too.
In his youth, the  Invoker learned Sadron's  Cold Snap alongside the nine other spells he currently wields, using three Quas orbs to invoke this spell for casting.
Having existed during the old ages when magic was primarily mnemonic, Sadron must've been quasi-immortal like the other mages whom Invoker sourced all of his spells from.
But this is just assuming that Sadron is still alive today, that is...
Much like the Invoker, Sadron might have the power to  Invoke spells with the cold energies of  Quas. Otherwise, Sadron can't have or even cast the  Cold Snap invocation (also known as Sadron's Protracted Frisson or Quas Frigoris) which is invoked with Quas Trionis.
This spell saps the heat from the victim to freeze them. The names “Protracted Frisson” and “Cold Snap” imply the freeze duration is brief but prolongable via additional attacks.
