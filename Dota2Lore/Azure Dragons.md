Azure dragons are a mysterious group of dragons in the lore of Dota 2.
Little is known about them, so most of their info is just pure speculation. It's unknown if azure dragons are a dragon species or a faction of dragons.
It is possible that the azure dragons are the same with the one from Chinese mythology. However, this may not make sense, because this is a dissonant relationship betwixt two mythos (Chinese and Norse mythology). Not to mention that the Azure Dragon from Chinese mythos is singular, in contrast to Dota 2's azure dragons who are plural.
But it's also possible that they're Slyrak's frost dragons. They protect an icy artifact that bestows the power of cold (like his frost breath) and are characterized by the color azure that's possibly referring to the color of their scales, which is similar to Slyrak's color as a frost dragon.
Judging by his name, it's possible that Azuremir is an azure dragon.
Azure dragons may have a relationship with the (possibly) goddess Skadi, given that they guard an eye that apparently belongs to her.
The azure dragons are the guardians of the extremely rare  Eye of Skadi.
