Druffins are an odd species of dragon in the world of Dota 2.
The druffin was discovered on an unnamed island in the Samareen Sea.

Druffins eat small fish.
Nature has made this animal fearless and tame due to unknown circumstances. It may seem like a disadvantage, but it makes them trusty animals to anyone who employs them.
Drodo is nothing but a druffin from an island in the Samareen Sea. His tameness allowed him to be employed as a trusty courier.
Following its discovery on an island in the Samareen Sea, hungry sailors hunted these dragons for delicious food and rapidly drove them to near extinction.
