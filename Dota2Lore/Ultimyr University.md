The Ultimyr University is a higher school of arcane arts. It is either the same, or related to the Ultimyr Academy. Among its professions are blacksmiths and scholars, who rarely cooperate, except to create dangerous new experiments. One such result was the Atomic Ray Thrusters engine, made for Aurel.
The Ultimyr Archives may be located in or around the Ultimyr University.
Scribes from the Ultimyr University have written about the Hellwether ram, a beast once thought to be legendary.
