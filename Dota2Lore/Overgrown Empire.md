This terrain is exclusive to players who own The International 2019 Battle Pass and leveled it to 160.
The day/night ambient sounds are layered on top of the soundscapes of the equipped Weather Effect.
The Overgrown Empire terrain has its own inbuilt Jungle Weather. This means it does not use the Default Weather when having no custom weather equipped.
Since custom weather effects only replace the default weather sounds, these sounds are not replaced by them, meaning only these ambient sounds play, no matter which weather effect is equipped.
When activating the monsoon weather, equipped custom weather effects do not work at all, so that they cannot be stacked up with the monsoon weather.
The monsoon weather causes sudden heavy downpours with lightnings and strong winds. They happen every randomly throughout the match and last a few minutes, although the first instance always happens at the 5th minute mark.
The Overgrown Empire was a civilization that flourished inside the jungles of Fellstrath. Its people worshiped the Mo'rokai, a pair of mythical, four-legged beasts with magical powers. Temples to the Mo'rokai can be found in the empire's former lands, its ruins stilled guarded by stone statues, now reanimated by the Ancients. Stone sentinels in the shape of glaring totems stood watch over the empire, and can still be found today. After the civilization fell, the Mo'rokai they worshiped went dormant.
Mireska Sunbreeze, on a journey in search of lost relics, entered the Fellstrath jungles and found her way to the empire's ruins. There, she disturbed the Mo'rokai from their slumber, causing them to rampage across the land in an attempt to destroy the Ancients.
