The Skywrath are a race of bird-like beings. They are ruled from the Ghastly Eyrie. The Skywrath are learned in magic, and are capable of performing powerful spells. However, they are known for being short-tempered, easily offended, and vengeful. The Skywrath worship Avilliva, and perhaps Scree'auk.
The Nest of Thorns is the seat of Skywrath political power. Here, backstabbing and intrigue occurs as Skywrath scions attempt to overthrow their rivals. Shendelzare, the first in line for the throne, was targeted by her sister, who sent assassins to kill her. In the struggle, Shendelzare lost her wings, making it impossible for her to ascend to the throne. Since then, Shendelzare has sought the powers of Scree'auk to regain what was rightfully hers.
The current queen of the Skywrath does not like Dragonus.
