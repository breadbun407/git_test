The hellwether emblem of the Vanguard is familiar to all who fight and bleed in the contested lands. The original shield, battered and worn, was found in a hoard of dragon’s gold, dug free from the deepest and oldest layers of treasure. Inscribed with ancient runes of protection (roughly translated by Ultimyrian scribes as, “Here no blade shall drink.”), this shield of the Vanguard was discovered to provide its bearer with magical protection against damage. Now, for a price, these special runes can be inscribed upon lesser shields, thus transforming them in power and likeness into the Vanguard of old.
