Crey is an underwater location, likely the site of a sunken city. Numerous hidden grottoes are located around the area. Umizar may be native to Crey, or live nearby.
The denizens of the sea gather in the grottoes of Crey to gamble on, and participate in a variety of bloodsports.  Slark has been known to participate in these events.
Crey was the place of a battle between the Slithereen Guard, led by Slithice, and an army of marauding Levianths, seeking to plunder its sunken treasures. Although the Levianth army was eventually driven off, a single chalice was found missing from the vaults of Crey, leading to Slithice being banished until it was recovered. The citizens of Crey, however were grateful for her services, and gifted her a piece of obsidian armor forged from the fires of an underwater volcano.
