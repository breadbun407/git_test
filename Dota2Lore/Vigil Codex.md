The Vigil Codex is a set of codes followed by members of the Vigil Knights. Little is known of this code except that it is rigid, and considered  Sven's existence an abomination, perhaps because of his mixed-race background. Sven's father was executed for violating the code, likely for siring a child with a meranth. The Vigil Codex was later burned by Sven in the order's Holy Flame as retribution for his father's death. Sven's personal code may be based on parts of the Vigil Codex, as he recites lines from the text when using  Warcry.
