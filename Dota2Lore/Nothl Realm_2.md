In the Nothl Realm, the properties of all things in the earthly world are inverted. But the most notable inversion of this realm lies within its version of light and dark. Its darkness emits a blinding glow that illuminates the blackest reaches of the light that permeates the realm. Anything that encumbers in the Nothl Realm will manifest as a source of strength on the material plane. Because of its paradoxical elements and inherent dangers, a spiritual journey to this realm can be very harrowing and dangerous. There is a chance that its visitants may never return their spirit to their home world, and some of its visitants may return mad or return with powers sourced from the realm itself.
