Vyxia was a powerful dragon in the lore of Dota 2.
She is heavily implied to be an Eldwurm because she is called a "grand dragon" in the only piece of lore that mentions herâ€”a title that's also used to refer to a massive dragon who is heavily implied to be the Eldwurm Slyrak.
Little is known about her besides the fact that she had tough scales and sharp teeth. Plus her blood is hot enough to heat metal. Even in death, her blood never loses its temperature.
Dragon Knight owns a sword forged from Vyxia's scales and teeth, its edge stained with her fiery blood that still heats it. Given that most of Davion's equipment is crafted from the dragons that he slays, it is possible that Sir Davion killed her.
