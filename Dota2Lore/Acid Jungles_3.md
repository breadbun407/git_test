The use of venom has evolved in many creatures of the Acid Jungle. One such creature, a reptile disguised as an epiphyte, stung Lesale and began his transformation into the Venomancer. Spitterpedes inhabit the jungle, hunting prey with projectile venom. The Splattering Forcipule, a distant relative of the Spitterpedes, anchors itself in damp crevices and between roots, killing and melting prey by spitting venom, then absorbing the nutrients from the corpse through their subterranean root-tendrils. The Fradjan Moth also inhabits the jungle, forming cocoons inside its many orchid species.
