The Graventome is a record of the successful heirs of the Graven King lineage and their feats. For generations, the pages of this text has been filled with the names of triumphant kings and the new domains they acquired with the help of the Oracles' supernatural resource of prophecies (decoded by their masters, the Cymurri) until Nerif metaphorically wrote the final page when he ended the Graven King lineage with his unforeseen consequences.
