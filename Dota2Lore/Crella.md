Crella was a powerful priestess from the Cathedral of Rumusque. Centuries ago, she forged the Chains of Abscession, enchanting them to bind the prime servants of the Dead God. However, over time, the Chains' enchantments became corrupted by the Dead God, took on a mind of its own, and carried out its new master's wishes in destroying Crella's homeland.
