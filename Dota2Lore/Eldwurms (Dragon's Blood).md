The Eldwurms or the Eldwyrms (also known as the Pillars of Creation or dragon souls/spirits to avoid confusion with generic eldwurms. Collectively known as the Thunder and the Manifold Forms) are the eight fundamental essences that support and sustain the existence of reality and its elements, exclusive to the animated series Dota: Dragon's Blood.
