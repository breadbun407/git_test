The Umbral Pact is a mysterious Infernal law in the lore of Dota 2.
This pact seems to maintain an ancient equilibrium of power among the three sovereign demons who rule over the Seven Hells. Shadow Demon broke this law by instigating a coup (presumably against his fellow demon lords) when he accumulated a cult of mindless puppets that contained his dark essence as part of his First Dominion to master the material plane to dark and inscrutable purpose.
Enforcers of the Umbral Pact, Doom and Shadow Fiend, got wind of his machinations and briefly joined forces to stop him. Combining their most powerful spells, they destroyed the demon offender and his cult before they could even proceed with their next step of the plan, restoring order to the Umbral Pact once more...for the moment.
