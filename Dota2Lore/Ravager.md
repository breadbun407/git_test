Ravagers are a type of animal, characterized by its long spines. They have an elongated muzzle, two long fangs, and a smooth underside, used for making sashes. Ravagers are hunted by the ursa, who consider their hunt sacred, and use all parts of the carcass. Their quills are threaded into clothing, and used as armor.
Ulfsaar owns a set of armor made from the remains of a ravager.
