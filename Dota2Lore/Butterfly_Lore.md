The tales called Butterfly a blade of betrayal, for it is said that in the hands of the uncertain swinging the sword brings with it a promise of disaster. Whether through its treacherous balance or its deceptive weight, the unprepared have been known to pay in blood and bone. Yet in the grip of the confident, few tools have proven more valuable or deadly. To use the blade properly it is said one must trust it completely, allowing it to wield the user. Follow its weight as it weaves a legato line with the enemy; feel its speed as it meets every staccato strike with one of its own. For the faithful, permitting the Butterfly to lead the course of combat will reward the warrior with a way into the heart of all foes. -- Monarch Bow description.
