Wraith essence (also known as wraith energy or wraith flesh) is a form of pure spirit energy. It is the essence that makes up the observable form of spiritual beings such as ghosts and revenants, taken up by the aforementioned entities when they need a form to walk the earth and shed upon their "deaths". It is the essence that is said to light the eyes of these beings.
Wraith King is the most notable user of this energy, being the second being to shape himself with Wraith Flesh. The first person to do so has been forgotten and long dead. Submitting himself to a trance by his Mage-Physician Azorszos and laid upon an altar, his champions harvested the Wraith Essence that charged the wildlife in the area, until he was finally reborn as an ethereal being. He spent the remaining Wraith Essence to shape his bone kingdom into a land of glowing wraith flesh.
On the millenial solstice known as Wraith-Night, a green aurora heralds the terrifying cascade of events: the barrier between the planes grow thin and the undead stir from their graves while the living succumb to possessionâ€”animated and empowered (respectively) by the leakage of Wraith Essence.
The Eldwurms' sagas contain information on Wraith Essence, the process involving its use in a discarnation ritual, and the first person to do it.
