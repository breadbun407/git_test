Castor Twin-Tusks was a character in the lore of Dota 2.
Based on his remains, he appears to be a beaverlike being. Unlike normal beavers, he was bigger and had tusks rather than incisors.
This riverlands hero once challenged  Nature's Prophet to an arcane duel. He lost the fight and his life to this Prophet, and his head (bereft of its lower jaw) was subsequently made into a spaulder that now rests on the Prophet's right shoulder as a trophy.
