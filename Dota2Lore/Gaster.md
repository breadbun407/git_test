Gaster is a character in the lore of Dota 2.
Before the advent of the epoch of Gaster, sorcerers were inept at close-quarters combat. For all their powers, they were nothing against a well-armed foe engaged in melee fight. Their only option against them would be to flee with a burst of defensive magery. Ever since this time of Gaster, however, this was no longer a problem for sorcerers, suggesting that Gaster's contribution aided the magic community with a powerful option versus melee combatants.
In his youth, the  Invoker learned Gaster's spell of  Alacrity alongside the nine other spells he currently wields, using two Wex and one Exort to invoke this spell for casting.
Having existed during the old ages when magic was primarily mnemonic, Gaster must've been quasi-immortal like the other ancient mages whom Invoker sourced his spells from.
That is, assuming that Gaster is still alive today...


Just like the Invoker, Gaster must have had the ability to  Invoke spells using the energies of  Wex and  Exort. Otherwise, this mage would not be able to cast  Alacrity (also known as Zeal of Wexort and Gaster's Mandate of Impetuous Strife), which is invoked by two Wex and one Exort.
This spell infuses the recipient with an immense surge of energy that hastens their combat capabilities, hence its “Alacrity” title. Perhaps Wex provides the spell's hastening power, while Exort provides the spell's amplifying effect.
