Davion tells a young boy to take a dragon fang to Dragon hold where he will take the test. Later Davion sent Bram there to inform about Fruhling's activities. Later it takes days to travel and serves as a pit-stop for Mirana and Davion in order to reach their destination. Kaden later faced Slyrak at Dragon Hold.
