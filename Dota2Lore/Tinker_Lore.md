Boush founded the laboratory beneath the Violet Plateau, where he developed various technologies, including robotic drones, rock cutting lasers, and homing rockets. After an experiment went awry in the laboratory, Boush was the only survivor to make it out alive. He believes it is unlikely that there are any other survivors.
Yurnero believes that Boush caused the Violet Plateau incident, and is criminally responsible for all the deaths involved.
Boush is friends with Beatrix Snapfire, a fellow keen, the two having collaborated on something many years ago.
