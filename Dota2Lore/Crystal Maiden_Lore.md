In her youth, Rylai once angered her master, the Ice Wizard, forcing her to exile herself to the Boiling Sea, where the Blueheart Glacier met the ocean. She spent months in meditation, seeking ways to prove herself worthy again of his tutelage. One afternoon, she awoke to speak a single word: "Snowdrop". And with that one word, she caused her surroundings to freeze, turning the steam into falling snow. When she returned to the Blueheart Glacier, she was greeted by the Ice Wizard, who had learned of her magical deed, and was impressed. As a reward, he gifted her a new outfit, to serve as proof of her mastery over the elemental ice.
Lina is Rylai's primary rival, and the two siblings feuded often in their childhood. In the past, Lina appears to have done her sister a great wrong, and is now living in guilt. After having spoken with Lina, Dont√© Panlin may have gotten her to concede remorse. Acting as a middleman, he relays this information to Rylai, telling her that Lina may be ready to make amends.
Unbeknownst to her, Kaldr has a crush on Rylai, and wishes to ask her out on date.
