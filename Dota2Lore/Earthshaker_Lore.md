Earthshaker was once an unnamed immortal being, able to take on various forms. He hails from Nishai, where he lay dormant until woken by an earthquake. Even in his slumber, Earthshaker was able to sense lifeforms around him. Assuming the form of a mortal beast, he is able to reshape his body at will, giving himself horns to defend against a hostile world.
He has befriended Gargoyles, a species that inhabits Nishai. There is evidence that he has some relations with Behemoths, whose remains he uses as armor.
Earthshaker is charged with protecting The Red Mountain, possibly a location in Nishai. He is hostile towards the Dire, equipping special totems imbued with light to counter its corruption.
Earthshaker recalls a "sister earth", another planet that that was destroyed by unknown beings. In its last moments, Earthshaker remembers it feeling great pain. A fragment from that planet has now merged with Earthshaker, and its power is re-awakening inside him. Having defeating one "interstellar traveler" who sought to destroy the remnants of his sister earth, he is now on the lookout for future attacks. At the same time, he seeks to understand how the sister earth was destroyed, and one day avenge her passing. In the mean time, he uses the fragment from his sister earth as a totem.
The entity that destroyed his sister earth also seek to destroy other worlds, and Earthshaker can feel them coming. He has met it before, in a different life, and was killed by it. According to him, the entity is not the only one of its kind.
To help him prepare for the upcoming confrontation, Earthshaker has had several conservations and disagreements with his friend  Io, asking it for its help in reaching another world. Intending to cross into space and meet the entity, he asks Io about relocation, and Zet about traveling through the cosmos.
Sensing Earthshaker's concerns, Inai is the only one to offer him answers.
