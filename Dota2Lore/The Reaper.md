Rey de los Muertos and Celeste
The Reaper is a deathly psychopomp in the lore of Dota 2.
Little is known about the deathly Reaper besides its appearance and its abode. In Dota 2, this foul Reaper is depicted as a figure whose disembodied form is cloaked by a sable shroud. This psychopomp always carries a massive scythe, most certainly used to harvest the souls of those who have departed from life. In Artifact, the Reaper is still depicted in the Book of the Dead as a dark hooded figure wielding a large scythe, but it appears the Reaper also has a pair of red eyes and a pair of wings that resemble that of an angel's feathered fins.
Like a hungry predator, the Reaper in Dota 2 is said to lurk beyond the veil of death for souls to harvest with its scythe, suggesting that it dwells in the Underscape.
But in Artifact, this Reaper is depicted in a skyscape similar to common interpretations of Heaven with the clouds and the sun's rays shining through them. This seems to elicit the idea that the Reaper must be an angel of some sorts.
The amount of death  Necrophos has caused with his power has garnered him a following from the Reaper. Thus he can summon the psychopomp itself to cull the living.
Nobody in Dota 2's lore likes  Leshrac. Even he knows that Death itself reviles him.
Within the Red Mist was its Reaper, who in truth was  Axe, a devil of a man who slew cowards and deserters. Perhaps the Red Mist Reaper was inspired by the psychopomp itself.
In  Pudge's biography, it is said that those who don't fear the Reaper do have Pudge to be afraid of, which Pudge himself asserts.
