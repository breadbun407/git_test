Inai is the first of the celestials, representing the void. He is known as the Hidden Ones, and resides in the Hidden Temple, only emerging to take part in the battle of the Ancients on the mortal plane. Still, he is able to create rips of space in the Astral Plane, which allows him to pass through them and destroy the Astral Plane over and over again.
 He instructs others, such as Lanaya, to do his bidding, all while remaining hidden to all but a few.
Now that he has stepped into the mortal realm, Inai seeks to unite with all the other celestials in an event he calls the Great Confluence.
After taking mortal form long ago, Inai constructed a temple to house his body and his artifacts. This likely refers to the Hidden Temple. The temple is hard to find for all except those he permits to come across it.
Mireska's Father spent much of his gold trying to find the temple, to no avail.
Lanaya is one of few mortals who was allowed to see the Hidden Temple and enter it. She now does Inai's bidding in exchange for secrets. Mercurial also serves Inai, but does not always follow his instructions.
Inai has great respect for the Korumite monks, who were scholars that studied both martial and magical arts. He respects their legacy in that almost nobody remembers who they were, similar to Void Spirit's own penchant for secrecy. His temple is constructed base on a Korumite design.
The Monks of Turstarkuri follow Inai's teachings, although Inai says they misunderstood his meaning, and were consumed by their folly when they were destroyed by the legions of the Dead God.
Sensing Earthshaker's troubles that began when he received a chunk of his sister earth, Inai offers him answers.
The elementalist Thunderkeg stumbled across a spell to summon the celestial Raijin, without knowing that the spell had been planted for him to discover by Inai.
Inai once sought out Barathrum's Master for unknown reasons.
Inai is familiar with the  Echo Sabre, having held it once before. He dislikes being in the mortal plane, but finds mortals amusing.
