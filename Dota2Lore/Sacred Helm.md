The Sacred Helm, now known as the Shattered Helm, was an important relic held by the Vigil Knights. It was smashed by  Sven as revenge for his father's execution at the hands of the order. The description for  God's Strength says that this ability was the same strength that was used to destroy the Sacred Helm, possibly implying that it was extremely durable if Sven had to rely on it to break the helmet.
