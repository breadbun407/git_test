Riftshadow Crystals are a type of rare artifact found in the Riftshadow Ruins. In ages past, ritualists conducted rites in a palace on the site, placing the souls of victims in a crystal, then shattering the crystal to split the soul into many pieces. Riftshadow Crystals are now highly valued by mages, and thus also prized by scavengers. They are still highly dangerous, however. Breaking a crystal by mistake will shatter one's soul into many, as was the case with Meepo. Through some unknown mechanism, breaking a Riftshadow Crystal also causes Meepo to disappear and teleport to another fragment of his soul.
