The prison is located near a Naga settlement. It is constructed inside a deep ocean trench, covered by a metallic grid. Its interior is described as dark labyrinth. Eels patrol the grounds, and exits are guarded by giant stinging anemones. Explosive mines are chained floating near the exterior, where several ships have wrecked and sunk around the upper entrance. Cetacean wildlife can be heard nearby, especially at night.
