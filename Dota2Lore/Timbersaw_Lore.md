Rizzrack is a member of a family that includes Beatrix Snapfire, who is his aunt. His mother, Beatrix's elder sister, took him and settled together in the Vale of Augury. She passed away under unknown circumstances, possibly during the attack on Augury Bay by the Treant Protectors, leaving her son traumatized.
Traumatized by the destruction of Augury Bay, Rizzrack is a little mentally unstable, acting constantly paranoid and speaking of voices in his head. For the same reason, he is not fond of  Treant Protector or  Nature's Prophet. Despite his devotion to destroying trees, he is not interested in fire.
His saw-suit comes with an ejection mechanism for the pilot, but seems to always fire too late.
