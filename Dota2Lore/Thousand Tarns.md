The Thousand Tarns is an area of the world, inhabited by peoples who worshiped demons, and demons who posed as humans. The Red Mist army, of which  Axe was a member, embarked on a seven-year campaign against the Tarnsmen, killing their demonic wargod. The blood of the slain later collected in the tarns, mixing demon and human blood together.
