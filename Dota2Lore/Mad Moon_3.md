But the forces inside still fought, and the Mad Moon began to show imperfections. It was then that Valora, the Dawnbreaker crashed into the moon whilst she was in her dormant state, she apologizes to Zet for her transgressions and vows to destroy both ancients. Zet's power waned, small weaknesses expanded, and eventually the sphere broke apart, raining down material onto the World. The remains of the Mad Moon settled as Radiant Ore and Direstone, pure materials of the two intelligences. The World fell into temporary chaos, though some took advantage of the situation. Abzidian, the Demon Smith, used this time to forge Demon Edge from the raw materials that fell.
