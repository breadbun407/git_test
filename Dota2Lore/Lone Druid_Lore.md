Alone stands Sylla the Lone Druid amongst the forgotten ruins of his prehistoric Bear Clan. Long ago, the forces of nature sought the most learned in nature's workings and Sylla stepped forth to answer. Given to him alone was the charge of protecting the Seed that it may fulfill one purpose: to sow it upon desolate land and sprout new life when the singularity of life bereft has come for the world. Hope for the planet's renewal after its utter desolation lies in this man, even when no one's around to root for him as he outlives us all.
Many were the places that the exiled Lone Druid chanced upon as he waited out the terminus of life's path in the great wheel of this world. One of these was this shadowy Onyx Grove, a darkling woods found amongst an enigmatic, northern pine. The Grove was a nexus for both fierce and strange creatures who have come here to quarrel in disharmony. In time, Sylla adapted his own form to suit whatever needs he may have in there and soon he joined the chaos as a massive bipedal bear.
At some point in time in his long, self-imposed exile to keep his burden safe, a great evil named Xahryx fell upon the forest with malicious intent. Sylla battled this foul force, grappling them for long until he rent the evil asunder with his paw. Although Xahryx was slain, their dark power still remained in the world, ripe for the picking. Lest that another evil may exploit their wildest power once again, Sylla claimed their cauldron for himself to put the depths of its power to heroic purpose and wore their skull as a trophy of their battle.
As clan judiciar, seer, and warrior of the forgotten Bear Clan, Sylla was like his fellows in focusing on their ways to seek an understanding of the natural order and restore the world.




Alone without his kin, and his precious and coveted burden forcing him to seek further solitude for its safety, Sylla's mighty  Spirit Bear is now his only true companion and friend that shall follow him to the end. It is a projection of his will and hence it is an extension of his own being. Like an extra, distant, complex limb that he can control remotely. Hence, it's a male bear that's symbiotic with his spirit and heart.

As such, he believes that eternity will be better off without him.
