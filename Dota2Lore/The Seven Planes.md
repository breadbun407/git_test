The Dota 2 universe is divided into Seven Planes of existence, each with their own characteristics. Physical beings that traverse between planes are subject to a powerful friction that damage their bodies. Spirits losts between the planes eventually become minerals.
Travelling between planes can be dangerous, as there exists interdimensional predators that stalk the dark corners of creation.
There is a web or seam that exists between the worlds.
Only four planes are currently known by name.
