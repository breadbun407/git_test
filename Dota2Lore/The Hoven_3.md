The demon Maraxiform set his sights of the Hoven, rising from sixth hell to claim dominion over the forest. He was met by Clinkz, who drove him back to the gates of Hell after a long battle. Just before his death, Maraxiform launched a barrage of hellfire, igniting the tar pools across the forest, and burning Clinkz alive in the process. However, in slaying the demon, Clinkz had inadvertently earned Sutherex's awardâ€“eternal life. And so, Maraxiform was vanquished, and Clinkz continued to live as a skeleton, forever engulfed in hellfire. Today, he continues to patrol the Hoven, albeit at great pain to himself.
