Augury Bay is a port city, and former home of Rizzrack. Judging by its similar name, it may have been located near the Vale of Augury. Its inhabitants were technologically advanced, likely made up of Keen, who constructed workshops to build great machines. Perhaps because of this reason, Augury Bay was attacked and destroyed by Treant Protectors, likely after it was discovered and categorized as a threat by Rooftrellen.
