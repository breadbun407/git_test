The artifacts of Riftshadow's past civilization are of great value to historians and collectors. Scavengers, like Meepo, collect carvings and sculptures from the ruins, and sell them in town for food. On rare occasions, one might find a Riftshadow Crystal, which is of particular interest to mages. Meepo has handled and accidentally shattered one of these crystals, which split his soul from one into many.
