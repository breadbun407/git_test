The thick jungle and canopy of Fellstrath hosts a number of plant and animal species. Palms and kapok trees grown here, along with venus flytraps, pitcher plants, and mysterious purple flowers. Brightly colored snakes make their home in foliage, as well as a great diversity of birds, including the great hornbill. Numerous nocturnal animals can also be heard at night, but are rarely seen. Crocodylians also inhabit the jungle, wielding spears in packs.
