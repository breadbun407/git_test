The Keen of Knollen are highly proficient with firearms. When a Keen father dies, his gun is passed down to his son. In order to become a full member of the village, a young Keen must pass an ancient test: kill a steepstalker in a single shot from the valley floor. To miss is to be disgraced. When Kardel killed his steepstalker, the bullet pierced the creature's central eye, and fell into its mandibles, signifying both his greatness and a dark omen. He was to achieve great renown on a battlefield, or never return.
