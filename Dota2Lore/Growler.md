Growlers are a species of bipedal ursine creatures in the world of Dota 2.
The growlers live in the cold region of Whitecap.
These ursine creatures are not too different from other bears. The only features that distinguishes them from other bear species is their bipedalism and arms that are longer than their short legs, and even then this is also shared with the Ursa. The hide of a growler is very tough and can be used as armor.
Prowling along the ponds and lakes of Whitecap, growlers prey upon the Frostwise Penguins.
Remi, a gastromancer who seeks to join the White Orchids by presenting a dish worthy of Heroes, grinded an Alpine Growler's fangs into a bone meal to create a soft shell for his tacos filled with Ogre Seal meat.
