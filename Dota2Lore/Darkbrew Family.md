The Darkbrew Family is a line of Keen specializing in the sacred science of chymistry. Its most prominent member is the brilliant and ambitious Razzil Darkbrew, the  Alchemist, who veered from family tradition to try his hand at transmuting gold with alchemy. The family appears to operate like a criminal organization, with enforcers who "collect with interest".
