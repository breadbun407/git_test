Aghanim was a mighty wizard whose abilities approached that of a demi-god. He owned the true legendary  Aghanim's Scepter. Although he was exceedingly powerful during his lifetime, he declined later in life and had become a has-been by the time of his death. The circumstances of his death are unclear, with conflicting stories passing around as rumors.
After his disappearance, his namesake scepter was passed onto his son,  Rubick. His secrets are closely held by Rubick, and coveted by people like Mireska, who desire its awesome power. Rubick lives in the shadow of his father, constantly striving to match his fame and power, but has not succeeded thus far.
