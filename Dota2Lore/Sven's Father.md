Sven's father was a member of the Vigil Knights order. He was executed after violating the Vigil Codex, likely for siring a child with a meranth.  Sven later took revenge for his father by destroying the order's Sacred Helm, stealing the Outcast Blade, and burning the Vigil Codex in the order's Holy Flame.
Sven's Father once owned the transforming Sword of the Warrior's Retribution, which passed onto his son after his death.
