Qine is a walled city in the world of Dota 2. When she was fifteen, Tresdin toiled in this city as a slave when the Bronze Legion laid siege to the walls of the city. They successfully claimed this city for Stonehall and took the remaining able-bodied folk as potential recruits for the Bronze Legion. It was in this city where Tresdin accepted the previous Legion Commander's duel to claim his position after he flaunted it to them, which she did not acquire despite Tresdin soundly defeated him and two other soldiers.
