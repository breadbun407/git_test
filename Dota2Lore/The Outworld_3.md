Unique to this realm is its crystalline structure, with a species of augural crystalline trees being native to the Outworld. The Outworld is rich in crystals that can produce arcane power, causing it to be awash in large amounts of arcane energy that is inclined to diffuse through the Outworld Destroyer's "rifts", likely implying that the process restores his mana. There is also a type of Outworld crystal with the ability to self-assemble, making it an excellent makeshift prison. If an Outworld crystal ruptures, it releases cataclysmic energies that can be felt interdimensionally.
