Xahryx was a mysterious and malevolent being that came upon the forest where Sylla roamed. It engaged in struggle with Sylla, who eventually defeated it. Judging by its skull, Xahryx was a creature with two curled horns and large fangs. Before his death, Xahryx owned a cauldron which stored wild powers. Fearing evildoers who may seek out this powerful relic, Sylla took the cauldron for safekeeping, and occasionally carries it on his back.
