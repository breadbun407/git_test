A variety of fauna can be found in this island. The more mundane creatures includes mountain yaks, mountain wolves, dogs with antlers, the high plains ram, wild boars, etc. Besides these rather uninteresting animals, there are several dangerous beasts that might have once lived in the islands. There are demons and great abominations that hunt with an alien intellect and a great brave beast with large tusks. Corodonts, long extinct beasts with hearts made of ivory, may have lived somewhere in the Ivory Isles.
