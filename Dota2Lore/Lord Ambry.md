Lord Ambry was the head of the House of Ambry, and father to Banehallow, the  Lycan. He ordered six thousand warriors of his house to take the capital from the corrupt Last King of Slom, but failed. For his betrayal, the king had his son cursed with lycanthropy, so that he would tear out his father's throat. Banehallow did not comply however, instead killing several of the King's knights, and fleeing into the darkness. Lord Ambry was then executed by the King's sword.
