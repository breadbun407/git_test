Tarak is a character in the lore of Dota 2.
Tarak must've made the  Chaos Meteor or at least was involved in its creation, since Tarak's possessive name is invoked when others cast this spell. Thus Tarak must be a mage.
But it isn't just Tarak who is invoked when others cast the spell, as Gallaron is also invoked when others cast it. It's unknown if these two mages are related to each other.
Since the young Invoker (who existed during the old times when spell-casting was once at its most potent form because it was still primarily a mnemonic art) learned the Chaos Meteor spell alongside his nine other invocations, Tarak must have existed during this golden age of magic as well and hence this obscure mage must've been an ancient one too.
In his youth, the  Invoker learned Tarak's  Chaos Meteor alongside the nine other spells he currently wields, using two Exort orbs and one Wex orb to invoke this spell for casting.
Having existed during the old ages when magic was primarily mnemonic, Tarak must've been quasi-immortal like the other mages whom Invoker sourced all of his spells from.
But this is just assuming that Tarak is still alive today, that is...
Much like the Invoker, Tarak must have had his power to  Invoke spells using the two energies  Exort and  Wex. Otherwise, Tarak would not possess or cast the  Chaos Meteor spell (also known as Tarak's Descent of Fire, Gallaron's Abyssal Carnesphere, or Voidal Pyroclasm), a spell invoked with two Exort and one Wex.
This unsophisticated but powerful invocation tears a fiery meteor from outer space and plunges it down to the earth, pulverizing and incinerating everything in its path.
