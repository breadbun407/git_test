Dragon's fire whiskey (also known as dragonfire whiskey) is an alcoholic drink first featured in and exclusive to Dota: Dragon's Blood.
Judging by its name and its surrounding context, Dragon's fire whiskey is one of the many products that the Knights of Dragon Hold source from dragons, possibly from Ember Dragon in particular with their fiery properties. It's unknown what ingredients does it have and what part of a dragon's remains is used for this stuff.
Combining alcohol's effects of giving the body a false sensation of warmth and the spice of dragon stuff, the drink is very hot and spicy. It seems to be light brown in color.
This powerful drink is exclusive to the dragon-slaying ranks of Dragon Hold.
As a person who enjoys alcoholic beverages very much, dragon's fire whiskey seems to be one of  Davion's favorites since he was pleased to find a bottle of this stuff in the pantry of a Dragon Knight redoubt and chugged a good amount of whiskey with no unpleasant reactions. After reuniting with Sir Davion in Dragon Hold, his best friend and squire Bram gave him a nice flask of dragon's fire whiskey to comfort him after a painful experiment on his body conducted by Father.
On the other hand,  Mirana took a sip of this whiskey once and coughed it out. Although she assumed that it was spicy before she drank it, she was still surprised by its taste.
