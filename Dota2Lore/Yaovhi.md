Yaovhi was an Ashkavorian woman, and Grimstroke's lover. She, like her kin, was transformed into a shadowy revenant by the corrupted ink tide unleashed during Grimstroke's Ascension.

Although Grimstroke does not generally mourn the passing of his people, he still feels a longing for Yaovhi, but tries not to dwell on the past.
