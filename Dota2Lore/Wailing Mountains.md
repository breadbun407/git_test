The Wailing Mountains is a location in the Dota 2 world.
Nested in the mountain peaks is the Ruined City.
In the mountain's valleys resides the Order of the Oyo, a sect that strives for enlightenment through alcoholic drink. Mangix, the  Brewmaster comes from the Wailing Mountains, and  Storm Spirit appears to have a connection to the area as well.
The Fortress of Flares lies lost within the mountains. It was once a training ground for future warriors, headed by Xin, but is now abandoned.
A kingdom of good-hearted people lived beyond the Wailing Mountains, among them the elementalist Thunderkeg.
