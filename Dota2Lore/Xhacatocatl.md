Xhacatocatl is a series of mist-shrouded mountains, home to Strygwyr and his people. The Flayed Twins watch over the mountains, where they demand regular sacrifices of fresh blood. To satisfy this, the priests of the mountains send out the  Bloodseeker to hunt down enemies, and transfer their blood to the gods. To the west of Xhacatocatl lies the drylands, where Bonehunters are sent out to hunt down and sacrifice great beasts.
The high peaks are known for its Hlotl beasts, fearsome creatures of fang and feather. The great bird of prey Iczoxtotec likely also flies over Xhacatocatl.
Trivia
It may be that these lands that are mentioned in their description are inspired by the lands of Peru, Machu Picchu, for their descriptions of the place where they have temples.
