The Bonehunters are a faction in service of the Flayed Twins. They scour the drylands west of Xhacatocatl for beasts to sacrifice to their gods. They adorn, arm, and armor themselves with the teeth and bones of slain beasts, using these primitive weapons that harken back from a time before steel. While the amount of blood they collect is meager compared to the amount collected in the mountains, they are well known for their ferocity.
