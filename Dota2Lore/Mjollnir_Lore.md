Mjollnir is a powerful divine weapon in the lore of Dota 2.
This magical hammer is the signature weapon of Thor, forged for him by the dwarves Brok and Eitri. It has the heavenly power to harness lightning and can only be lifted by its owner.
Dawnbreaker is impressed by the power of Mjollnir, but still believes that it is no match for her Brightmaul.
Hoodwink implies that this hammer can only be lifted by its owner, like the original. And yet she can lift it, which confuses her.
Void Spirit recognizes this weapon, merely calling it a "divine plaything" in spite of its godly power.
Faceless VÃ´id states that this weapon is known in Claszureme whose inhabitants speak of it in hushed tones.
What is presumably copies of Mjollnir are sold by Keepers like the Secret Shop's owner for gold. These copies don't inherit the restriction of the original, allowing others to lift it.
