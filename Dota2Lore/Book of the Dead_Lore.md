The Book of the Dead, or the Book of Life and Death, is a tome of names that records every soul who has died. It is presumably kept in the Underscape, or near the Narrow Maze, where it is routinely updated by Razor.
During his time in the Narrow Maze, Sun Wukong managed to escape and erase his name and several others from the Book of the Dead. A few blessed individuals have returned to life from the Narrow Maze, although how exactly is unknown.
