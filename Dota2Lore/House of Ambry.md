The House of Ambry was a noble house and the greatest member of the landed caste in the kingdom of Slom. It was headed by Lord Ambry. They had some claim to royalty, as had amongst them nobleblood generals, suggesting military forces under their command.
When The Last King of Slom became visibly corrupt, the House of Ambry sent six thousand warriors to take the capital, but failed, resulting in the Massacre of the Apostates. Enraged by betrayal, the King ordered Lord Ambry brought before him, and had his sorcerers curse Banehallow, Lord Ambry's son, with lycanthropy, with the intention of having him kill his own father. Banehallow instead escaped in his wolf form, while Lord Ambry was eventually executed by the King himself. The vast bloodline of Ambry was executed by royal decree, leaving Banehallow, the  Lycan as its last surviving member.
After the fall of the House, the Ambry family estate was sacked.
