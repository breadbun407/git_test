His status as the last of his kind didn't last forever. Unbeknownst to him, his own mask is actually the vessel of the dormant souls of his warrior ancestors, an ancient lineage of revered warriors. In life, they were branded as traitors to the Isle, denied a noble death, and stripped of their honor, similar to their descendant Yurnero. These sleeping souls would soon be reawakened when their vessel was split in half by Sven with the Adjudicator's Blade restoring a small portion of the Masked Ones' presence back to life. Now at one with the being of Yurnero, they seek to reclaim their lost honor and restore the Isle of Masks and its people, which will all be achieved once their opposing Ancient has been destroyed.
