Tornarus is a character in the lore of Dota 2.
Tornarus most certainly made or at least was involved in the creation of the  Tornado spell, since their possessive name is invoked by others who use it. Thus Tornarus is a mage.
Seeing how this young Invoker (who existed during the ancient ages when wizardry was once at its most potent form, because 'twas still primarily a mnemonic art) learned his Tornado spell alongside his nine other invocations, Tornarus must have existed during this golden age of magic as well and thus this obscure mage must've been an ancient one too.
In his youth, the  Invoker learned Tornarus'  Tornado alongside the nine other spells he currently wields, using two Wex orbs and one Quas orb to invoke this spell for casting.
Tornarus must've been a quasi-immortal like the other ancient mages whom Invoker sourced all of his spells from. Assuming that Tornarus is still alive today, that is...
Just like the Invoker, Tornarus must have had the power to  Invoke spells with the energies of  Quas and  Wex. Otherwise, Tornarus wouldn't be able to have or cast  Tornado (also known as Claws of Tornarus or Wex cyclonus), a spell invoked with two Wex orbs and one Quas orb.
A fast tornado goes forth and sweeps up anything in its path. Suspended in the air, victims are subject to its dizzying winds before it dissipates, allowing them to plummet.
