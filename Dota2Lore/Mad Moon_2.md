Once, the ancient intellects Radinthul and Diruulth warred with each other endlessly, both born of a great primordial mind that shattered upon the universe's creation. The two forces, complete opposites in every way, could find no compromise between each other. Zet, another fragment of the primordial mind, grew tired of their strife and fused his siblings into a single sphere. He flung them into space to drift for eternity. Eventually, this sphere was captured in the orbit of a still cooling world, Earth, shining over it as the races came into being. Because of its power, the Mad Moon glowed brightly over the Earth, competing even with the brightness of the sun.
