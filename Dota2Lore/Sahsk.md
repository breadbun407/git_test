Sahsk was a sorcerer that oppressed the kingdom of Yoskreth. Not much is known of his magic, save that he wielded "vile enchantments".
Tired of suffering, the sovereign of Yoskreth summoned the famous  Anti-Mage to defeat Sahsk. Overcoming the sorcerer's enchantments, Anti-Mage slew Sahsk, and was rewarded with fine armor, silks, and weapons by the sovereign.
