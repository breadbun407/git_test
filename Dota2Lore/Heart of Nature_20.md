When  Enigma receives a “treasure” of great worth, he will mention its source: a place he calls the “fundament of nature” and the “core of the universe.” These two names might be referring to a single place and both names are synonymous with the heart of nature, which means that he may be referring to this said plane of existence. This makes him one of the few entities to know about the evil truth of nature. Him knowing this place may also explain why he's nihilistic and pessimistic like Leshrac and Ash. Upon acquiring an  Arcane rune, Enigma reuses the second voice line, implying that these runes come from the core of the universe for some reason.
