The Ultimyr Academy is a school of arcane arts. It's most celebrated pupil is Demnok Lannik, who entered the academy to learn magicks that would help him in his quest to discover rare texts. Scribes translate ancient runes in the academy, including those found on the Guard of the Red Mist.
Other institutions like the Ultimyr Archives and the Ultimyr University may be related to the academy.
