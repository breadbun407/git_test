The Bladebreaker Order is an organization that believes in disarming its opponents, instead of killing them. Members are armed with grooved daggers and armor, to catch incoming blades in mid-swing. Some also wear counterweights on their tails. Their colors are yellow, purple, and blue.
Riki may be a member of the order, and the order may be related to the House of Tahlin.
