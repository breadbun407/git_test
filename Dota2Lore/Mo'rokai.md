The Mo'rokai are a pair of monstrous beasts that inhabit the jungles of Fellstrath. They are large, quadripedal beasts, with a crown of horns and a multitude of fangs. Flaring scales grow on its back, forearms and tail. The Mo'rokai exhibit magical abilities over the elements, including the power to summon spirits to do their bidding.
Among the ruins of the Overgrown Empire, temples dedicated to worshiping the Mo'rokai have been found, defended by stone guardians.
The two Mo'rokai remained dormant for centuries until they were roused from their slumber by Mireska Sunbreeze, who chanced upon them on her journey to find relics.
