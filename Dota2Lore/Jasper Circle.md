The Jasper Circle is an organization that specializes in illicit activities. They carry out their devious deeds with professional ethics, giving them an respectable air.
Lorlin Lasan and Riki are likely members of the organization, both being assassins. Mireska once worked and learned under Lasan in the Jasper Circle, but decided not to join because she did not want to be an "errand girl".
Meepo has dealt with the Jasper Circle before, and apparently owes them an unpaid debt. Because of this, Lasan and the Jasper circle are out to assassinate him.
