Mushlings are a race of fungus-like beings that live in underground environments like The Emerald Abyss and The Underhollow. They are a primitive people, armed with hunting spears. The Mushlings hunt and eat axolotls and beetles, which they roast over a fire. Some have been observed worshiping giant drills, possibly those of the Eimermole.
