Among the four spirits, Raijin is the youngest spirit among them. Raijin found the Wailing Mountains too constricted for his taste, so he ventured out to manipulate the winds of the wider world. Before he even set foot outside the peaks, he was caught into a bungled summoning spell that was secretly planted by his eldest brother for Thunderkeg to find and clumsily cast by an amateur elementalist named Thunderkeg who had hoped to end a drought. What happened next in this story can be read in his biography.
Storm Spirit (or at least his mortal half Thunderkeg) shares ancestors with  Ember Spirit,  Earth Spirit,  Void Spirit, and the  Brewmaster. Mangix might be referring to Thunderkeg rather than the Storm Spirit, because the former also comes from the Wailing Mountains. When Mangix dies, he asks him to bury his body beneath the Ruined City.
Storm Spirit has an ancient rivalry with  Razor, likely dating to a time before Raijin merged with Thunderkeg. Razor's lore implies that the rivalry began when he stole energy from sentient storms (likely referring to Raijin) which made these storms very angry.
Grimstroke despises Raijin, possibly due to some calamity he once inflicted on Ashkavor.
In the story of Artifact, Storm Spirit has an intense rivalry with  Zeus.
Amidst the landmass that has been torn by the skirmishes of Ancients, Humans, Oglodi, Vhoul and other beings of the mortal flesh, a new battle of divine proportions rises to shake the already fragile world of mortals. Not wanting to share the authority over all that is storm and weather, and refusing to bow to a pathetic excuse of a mortal god, Storm Spirit must battle against Zeus to prove that there is only one true lord of lightning...and to remind him that for all his remaining godly powers, he still has to walk with his feet.
Every time he and Zeus have to meet, they always end up dealing with each others' posturing before having a serious conversation. He also had a competition of power against Zeus, with Zeus earning the first point by destroying a building. In response to this feat, Storm Spirit destroyed an entire army to settle the matter. Frustrated, the mortal god had a temper tantrum and reduced an entire city to a crater.
