The Acid Jungles is a biosphere, located on the Jidi Isle, across the Bay of Fradj. It is a large biome, well over two leagues in diameter. Highly venomous creatures have evolved in the jungle, making it a very dangerous place. The herbalist Lesale once attempted to explore the jungles, but was stung by a poisonous reptile, which transformed him into the  Venomancer.
