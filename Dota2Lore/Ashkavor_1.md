Ashkavor is a land near the mountains that lead to Fellstrath. It is home to Grimstroke and his former lover, Yaovhi. The Ashkavorians are known for their Ascended Ones, specially selected individuals who undergo training and ritual to become guardians of their people. Ashkavor has at least one city, with a temple. Ascension rituals are performed here, near the temple's central runestone, which is painted over with a brush to initiate the Ascended Ones' binding spell.
