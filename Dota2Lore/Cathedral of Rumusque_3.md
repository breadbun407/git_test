The Cathedral hosts its own clergymen, who appear to believe in fighting death, decay and corruption. Here, popes have worked to serve under an unknown deity or purpose, but it is evident that they spread a sort of holy scripture and promise salvation and spiritual rewards if one were to accept their teachings. The grand priestess Crella was one such cleric, and it was she who forged the Chains of Abscession to bind the servants of the Dead God.
