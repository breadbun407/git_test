The Book of Heavens is a lost book containing studies on the skies in the lore of Dota 2.
Now lost to History along with its authors, the great Book of Heavens only exists as mere fragments of centuries' worth of prose, these fragments being mere copies of certain passages from the original book that can be found in the ruins of ancient temple or in scholarly works of moldering libraries.
The Book contained the very first instance of timekeeping in Dota 2's lore in the form of records on the amount of days in each season. It was also a record of the aesthetes of Keyturn's studies on the heavens, such as their discovery of the solstices and records of the movement and arrangement of celestial bodies in the skies. But the most notable content of the Book was the aesthetes' discovery of the Wraith-Night solstice, a long night whereby green auroras appear in the sky and the interplanar barrier thins, allowing the souls of the dead to spill over to our world and rise again to haunt the land.
Uncounted generations of the Aesthetes of Keyturn contributed to this vast book, writing down their findings and discoveries of their studies on the skies on each of its pages.
In his final journal entry, Azorszos spoke of ancient texts that portend Wraith-Night. He may be talking about the Book of Heavens, the only known book with info on this event.
