The Apotheosis Blade is a powerful weapon in the lore of Dota 2.
This Apotheosis Blade is the flaming sword of Lucifer himself, forged out of steel. As its name suggests, this wicked blade was forged to fulfill a single purpose: to allow the wielder to kill a god and assume their power. It is wreathed in the same fires that were used to brand Lucifer's wings six and sixty-six times until they were reduced to smoking stumps.
Doom wields the Apotheosis Blade by default. It's not explicitly said, but the similar appearance of the Apotheosis Blade and his default sword should be proof enough.
Dark Willow has plans to steal the Apotheosis Blade in the future.
Lycan is well aware of its wickedness and plans to use it to exact his revenge on an unknown enemy.
The Apotheosis Blade is currently safeguarded inside the Burnt Hall of Weeping Rose.
