Seeking new herbal essences, the herbalist Lesale crossed the Bay of Fradj to investigate the plants of the Acid Jungle. After being stung by a poisonous reptile, he quickly concocted an antidote from the nectar of an armored orchid, and the venom of the reptile itself. This antidote did not cure him, but instead, sent him into a seventeen year long coma. The combination of venom and nectar began to transform his flesh. He was reborn as the Venomancer, a snake-like being with extremely potent toxins. How much of his human mind remains is uncertain.
