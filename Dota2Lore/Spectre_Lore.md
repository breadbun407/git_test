At some point in time and through unknown means, a solitary Haunt from Mercurial's shattered identity was enticed and trapped into a cursed set of armor. Enraged, this lone Haunt described the armor as a "cage" since it trapped her from the original Spectre, but she soon realized that it was actually a "door" to freedom: a door that would lead to her becoming a separate entity from the original Spectre. To open this "door" and walk through it, she needed to harvest souls for the armor so that it can grant her a stronger sense of self. With the promise of freedom within her reach, she no longer wishes to rejoin the original Spectre and is now on a rampage to harvest the souls of those unfortunate to cross her path, all in the name of gaining true individuality.

Mercurial finds her kin in the likes of Azwraith and Meepo, who both have the ability to duplicate their presence. Despite this, she regards them as unworthy and inferior respectively.
