Aziyog is an underground city, located beneath the magma layer and below volcanoes. The city is formed from obsidian, and consists of an enormous subterranean cavern, adorned with fine stonework. The walls of the cavern are honeycombed with small grottoes, mortared with the bones of slaves.
Within the city dwells the Abyssal Horde, along with Vrogros, their  Underlord. Seeking conquest and new lands, Vrogos calls on his horde to march from Aziyog to the surface, and do battle with the nations above. Vrogros refers frequently to the Abyss, likely another name for Aziyog.
