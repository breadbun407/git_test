Brewmaster is the progeny of his Celestial father, and mortal mother. Like other Celestials, he has an affinity with the natural elements of wind, fire, and earth. Unlike other Celestials, however, Mangix is the only one attuned to more than one element. Because of this, he is able to split into three separate elemental warriors, although he may not be fully aware of this ability, as he is always inebriated when this split occurs. Mangix prefers alcoholic spirits, and disdains rum. He shares the same ancestors as  Storm Spirit,  Ember Spirit,  Void Spirit, and  Earth Spirit, and regards Storm Spirit as a cousin. The Ruined City is of particular importance to Mangix, where he hopes to return to one day, and be buried there.
