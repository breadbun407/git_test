This place is a fairly mundane forest, but it is an important passageway for those who want to reach the coast beyond the woods to transport their freight for commerce. However, it is very dangerous to traverse because of its fearsome inhabitants that are hostile to outsiders. Because of the prominent presence of lupine predators in the area, it is called the Howling Weald. Wolf dens exist in this forest. Thunderstorms and heavy rain are common in this place.
