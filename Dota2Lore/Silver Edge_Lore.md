The Silver Edge is a powerful weapon in the lore of Dota 2.
A past event involved the Silver Edge being used to slay an unjust king, only to have his realm erupt into civil war in the aftermath. Regardless, it can turn its wielder invisible.
There was once a time when the Bloodletter and the Chainbreaker used the Silver Edge to “stop” the  Wraith King, but some details of this event are unknown.
