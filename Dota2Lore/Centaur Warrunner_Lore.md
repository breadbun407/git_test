Bradwarden is the champion of the centaur race, having won his honor by killing every challenger in the arena of Omexe. Awarded the prestigious Great Belt of Omexe for his feat, Bradwarden commands respect, and fellow centaurs rally to join in him combat. Like other centaurs, Bradwarden believes combat to be the ultimate art form, likening swings of his blade to singing. He has accumulated at least a hundred victories in the arena, as evidenced by his Bloodrage Axe, taken from a vanquished warrior. As part of his duties, Bradwarden protects the Gloried Horn of Druud, a sacred relic that calls all centaurs to battle.
When he dies, Bradwarden wishes to be buried in the grounds of Omexe.
Bradwarden has some connection to the Marrowfell Hunters.
