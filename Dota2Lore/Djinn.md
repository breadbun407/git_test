Djinn are a mysterious sort of magical creature in the lore of Dota 2.
Little is known about the nature of djinn, besides them being powerful entities capable of impressive magical feats. It's implied that one may barter with djinn for power.
The Djinn of Qaldin is the only known djinn in Dota 2's lore, best known for forging Crixalis' magic carapace and filling it with the sentient sands of the Scintillant Waste.
The  Sand King's magical armour was forged by the cunning Djinn of Qaldin, who also poured an infinitesimal portion of the vast and sentient Scintillant Waste into his carapace to give it form. In battle, Crixalis sometimes invokes the Djinn. A supplicant to the Djinn, Crixalis raises his claws incised with the runes of Qezh to summon its full attention.
Djinn are said to inhabit the sorcerer town of Weeping Rose, where others may barter with them for power with an unknown price.
