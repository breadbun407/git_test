The Fradjan Moth is a species of moth found in the Acid Jungles of Jidi Isle. It is named after the nearby Bay of Fradj. The caterpillar of the Fradjan Moth makes its cocoons inside the Acid Jungle's armored orchids. One such cocoon was accidentally consumed by Lesale when he attempted to use an orchid to concoct an antidote. The form of a Fradjan Moth was subsequently merged into his new body.
