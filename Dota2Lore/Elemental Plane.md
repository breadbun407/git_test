The elemental plane (also known as the elemental realm or elemental force) is a plane of existence in the lore of Dota 2.
Existing far beyond our material world which is a shadow of this plane, the greater elemental plane is the domain of the elements and the elementals' home.
The elemental plane is possibly implied to exist between the planes, since Barathrum (who hails from this plane) says he is from the interstitial space between the planes. If so, then this plane generates a damaging friction on the physical forms of those who slide into this realm. Spirits lost in this plane eventually become minerals to be mined and forged.
Piling more mystery and doubt on  Enigma's true identity is his status as an elemental who returns to the “elemental force” when he dies to reform himself.
According to Barathrum,  Leshrac is a fellow walker between the planes. But this may be a reference to the planeswalker Leshrac from the Magic: the Gathering card game.

Such is the heat of the  Dragon Knight's resolve that it combines the elemental and terrene planes into one, presumably allowing him to manipulate the fire element.
The lesser terrene plane is just a shadow of the real world  that is the elemental realm.
Those of the elemental plane seek victory and success in the war of the Ancients, for defeat in this battle causes unpleasant repercussions in their home.
