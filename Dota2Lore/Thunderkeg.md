Thunderkeg was an elementalist who lived in a land beyond the Wailing Mountains. He was known for his good humor and joviality.
Seeing his people suffer from famine and drought, Thunderkeg found a forbidden spell, placed there by Inai, the  Void Spirit. When it cast the spell, it summoned Raijin, the Celestial of storm and thunder. This displeased Raijin greatly, who instead used his powers of wind and flood to destroy Thunderkeg's homeland. The elementalist tried to fight the Celestial, but his powers were not enough. In a final act of desperation, he cast a suicidal spell that drew Raijin into his body, imprisoning him within. In doing so, Thunderkeg merged his being with the Celestial, and the two became known as Raijin Thunderkeg, the  Storm Spirit.
