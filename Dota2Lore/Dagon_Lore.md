Dagon is a extremely potent weapon of sorcery in the lore of Dota 2.
This wand shoots a powerful burst of reddish magic energy. Starting out as a lesser wand, it grows more powerful the longer it's used.
Grimstroke (who is fond of antiques) seems to be familiar with Dagon, referring to it as his "old friend". He recognizes its synergy with his powers, such as  Soulbind.
The transformation of the  Nyx Assassin from his goddess' blessing has imbued him with strange energies, causing a growth that allows him to channel the power of Dagon.
