Maraxiform is a demon in the lore of Dota 2.
Clinkz is renowned for saving the Hoven from Maraxiform when he slew the demon in battle, but this noble deed has given him an eternity of torment by the demon's last breath.
Grimstroke appreciates what Maraxiform did to Clinkz, believing his tortured existence is the demon's best work of art. He regrets his decision to end him and his suffering.
Nyx Assassin seems to know Maraxiform and the fate the demon reserves for Clinkz in death.
Aware of Maraxiform's final deed,  Shadow Demon thinks that the demon “botched the job” for some reason. This may imply the following speculation:
Sutherex learned Maraxiform's invasion of the Hoven and responded to the threat by attempting to rally defenders via decreeing a spell of immortality as a motivation and a reward to those who kill the demon. Clinkz unwittingly earned the spell, which combined with Maraxiform's last breath to preserve him as the Hellfire torments him forever.
Maraxiform rose to the Hoven from a gate to the Sixth Hell with the intention of claiming the forest. This demon attacked the arboreal kingdom until Clinkz battled the beast in mortal combat, driven back to the threshold of the fiery gates, where this demon died to his last arrow, but not without letting out one last blast of Hellfire that incinerated Clinkz and ignited the Hoven's tar pools.
Maraxiform is a demon of the sixth level of the Seven Hells, whence he rises from into the mortal plane through fiery gates.
As a demon, Maraxiform had the natural ability to breathe Hellfire. Hellfire can cremate lesser beings in mere seconds and is eternal with its ability to burn and torture the soul.
Besides a power over Hellfire, Maraxiform must've had the other general powers of a demon, such as the heat of Hell in their veins and an immortal rage.
An interesting thing to notice is that Maraxiform had this power to travel to the mortal plane from the Sixth Hell through fiery gates, something that only the Demon Lords are capable of doing with their explicit access to this plane. This implies that Maraxiform must've been a very powerful demon, unless someone else helped the demon enter this world...
