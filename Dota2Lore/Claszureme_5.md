Darkterror hails from Claszureme, and is able to pass through the realm by tearing a hole in time. He is also able to open a rift to Claszureme, trapping and pausing time for all things within a dimensional bubble. Beings traveling to the normal realm from Claszureme often arrive in uncertain timelines, and require guidance to avoid being lost in time. Puck has been to Claszureme, where he learned that Darkterror is not wanted in the realm, and many of its inhabitants are glad to see him depart to the mortal realm.
