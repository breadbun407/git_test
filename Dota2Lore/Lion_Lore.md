Lion has met Donte Panlin before, and is greatly disliked by him. Donte warns him that if they should ever meet again, there would be consequences.
While the Bronze Legion and the Red Mist fought their wars, Lion had his own conflict to deal with. Hunted by the Court of Ristul for his transplanted demonic hand and the Tyler Estate for his unholy usage of magic, Lion sought asylum in the Weeping Rose. He must first seek out the Emissary of the Quorum, who will hear his plea for asylum. In exchange for that, he may share his secrets to the Quorum.
Several voice responses indicate that he is willing to work for the Tyler Estate in exchange for his freedom. He also thinks that Silencer should recognize his usefulness, due to his similar anti-magic abilities such as  Mana Drain.
The Lich also seeks to kill him before he reaches Weeping Rose, for reasons unknown.
