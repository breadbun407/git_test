The creatures of darkness (also known as the creatures of the dark, night creatures, creatures of the night, creatures of primordial night, creatures of the primordial night) are an ancient race of dark beings in the lore of Dota 2.
Judging by the scope of the Golden Ones' mission, the night creatures lived wherever darkness is in the cosmos or they may have lived on planets, like Dota's 2 Earth-like planet.
With most of the primordial night creatures exterminated on the First Day, their untethered souls now dwell in the void where Balanar calls them from to haunt the living world.
The following information about what the night creatures looked like is solely based on the only known surviving specimen of this race, Balanar the Night Stalker.
Possessing a humanoid form, the creatures of the primordial night were said to have a magnificent stature, which may include a toned physique just like Balanar's.
Daylight is lethal to all night creatures (except for one who is weakened by it instead) if they are exposed to it, as shown in the holocaust of the night creatures on the First Day.
The last of his kind,  Night Stalker is the sole survivor of the holocaust on the First Day. Besides that, there are many aspects of Balanar that make him special from his kin.
Breklin has some features that are also seen on Balanar: green eyes, red strips of flesh on some areas of his body, and blue skin with lighter patches. He could be a night creature.
A warrior of the light, the  Dawnbreaker is the scourge of the night and its creatures. As the last herald of the light, the night creatures prevail when she dies.
Grimstroke is an appreciator of the primordial night creature Balanar, feeling nothing but displeasure in the killing of a creature of great beauty.
Mars has a similar opinion with Grimstroke on the aesthetic of Balanar. He expresses this by planning to mount his head above his mantle.
If the  Void Spirit demands respect from Balanar since Inai is his elder, then perhaps the other night creatures, by extension, have reverence for the void.
Along with assuming their progenitor's mantle in illumining the world, the Children of Light also undertook a mission to scour all primordial night creatures from the cosmos.
