White Spire is a city located just beyond the reach of Stonehall and Revtel. It is built vertically. Gambling is an important part of White Spire's culture, including betting on animal and courier races, which Meepo, Mireska, Donte Panlin are known to indulge in. Gondar also gambles at White Spire, where he is known to cheat.
White Spire also has a thriving criminal element, which was previously kept in check by a person known as Momma Eeb. Following her murder, the city's underworld descended into chaos as gangs and criminal organizations scrambled to fill the power vacuum created by her death.
