The Dreadknight was a figure who invaded the realm of Ostarion. He owned an inscribed cloak that was supposed to make him invincible.
The Dreadknight was eventually defeated, and his remains made into a suit of armor and a sword for  Wraith King. His Magnoceros accomplice was also slain, and his head made into a pauldron.
