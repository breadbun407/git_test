The Cathedral was once stricken by a powerful plague, along with the rest of the nearby population, killing most of the priests and popes that worked there, save for a lucky few, one of which was Rotund'jere, who would then become the Necrophos after being thrown into a "plague ward", a room possibly contained inside the cathedral, said to be "ensorcelled with spells" that will inflict those who stay inside it a slow and lingering illness.
