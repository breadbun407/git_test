The Last King of Slom grew increasingly eccentric, demanding exotic beasts and surrounding himself with sorcerers. Sensing avarice behind the throne, the House of Ambry rose up against the King, sending six thousand warriors to take the capital. This rebellion failed, resulting in the Massacre of the Apostates. The King then had Lord Ambry executed, and had his son Banehallow cursed with lycanthropy.
