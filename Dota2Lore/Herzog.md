Herzog is a character exclusive to the series of Dota: Dragon's Blood.
He keeps and is the owner of the Shoehorn, a den where bounty hunters can be hired.
Luna and Hieronimo entered his Shoehorn for the intent of finding Vinari, the bounty hunter who assassinated  Mirana in her chambers. He claimed to not have Vinari under his roster, but helped the pair by giving the former access to his armory, arming Luna with a spear that she later used to fight the assassin.
