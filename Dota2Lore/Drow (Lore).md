The Drow are a diminutive race that inhabit the forests. Short and physically repulsive, the Drow are covered in warts and coarse whiskers. They value silence, stealth, and sublety, and have been known to aid strangers in need. The  Drow Ranger was adopted by Drow after her parents were slain by bandits. Some Drow can take other forms, known to others as changelings. The Northern Drow, a branch of their race, lives near the arctic regions.
Drow have some knowledge of magic, and have means to silence incantations. Drow Ranger worships a certain owl spirit, perhaps learned from the Drow.
The Drow tend to Bloodroot Trees in sacred caverns, holy sites of terrible battles that determined the fate of all Drow. These trees are heavily guarded, and trespassers who disturb them are killed. Only through careful etiquette and ritual can parts of the tree be taken for use.
The Drow have a mining culture, extracting certain minerals, particularly as Pincher Iron. The Northern Drow also mine ores from the chasm, using them to create armor.
