Lucius Longclaw is a character in the lore of Dota 2.
He seems to be the alpha among the wolves of the Howling Weald and the wolf-kin of the Longclaw Clan. Having a magical wolf amulet in his possession, he is one of the few inhabitants of the Weald to have access to magic, which seems to be exclusive to the Longclaws.
For an entire generation, Lucius Longclaw and his clan has been defending the Howling Weald against Bogdugg and the Bonemeal Ogres, who seek to claim the Weald from them.
Lucius and his clan often attack Commander Targan and the Kalabor soldiers who have encroached upon their Weald. He attacked their camp for the last time with his pack and clan to avenge those who were slaughtered in their dens, but they were all slain by the four Heroes of the Conclave of the Brine and Targan's forces.
