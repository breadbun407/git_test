The Sordid Era was a historical period. It was characterized by a long drought, lasting thirteen seasons. The people of this period blamed the famine and disease caused by the drought on traveling magicians, one of whom was Rhasta. This attitude continued into the next era, where mages caught were flayed and displayed on roads if they were caught on their journeys. Throughout this period, Rhasta disguised his shamanic abilities by dressing and acting like a vagabond.
