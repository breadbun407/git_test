Goff was the king of an unnamed kingdom. He became mad and tyrannical, and went into hiding. Regarding his demise, one rumor exists. According to this rumor, Goff was tracked down by Gondar, who killed him, collected his head and his scepter. If Goff's court jesters are to be believed, the only glimpse of Gondar before the king's assassination was a dancing shadow.
