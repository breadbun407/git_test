Lastly, the mysterious guardians are a group of beings who protect the fabric. All we know about these guardians is that they have scissors which they use to purge rogue patches that pull against the fabric of creation that the Loom had woven, and then repair that gap in the fabric by reweaving itâ€“which was the case with Skitskurr and his attempt to create his own world. These guardians might be the personification of Fate that Weaver talks about, who also weaves threads together and cuts threads with a blade.
