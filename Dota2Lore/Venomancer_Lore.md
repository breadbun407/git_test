Once, after a battle, Lesale crawled into a crack in the ground to recover from his injuries. Little did he know that the spot was a gathering place for worshippers of Aktok, an ancient serpent god. When the followers came to the spot to offer their sacrifices, they mistake Lesale for an avatar of Aktok, and worshiped him accordingly. Lesale accepted their offerings, resting until his strength returned, then rose to follow the cultists back to their village, where he ate them all.
