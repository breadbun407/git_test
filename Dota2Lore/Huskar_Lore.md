Huskar is a sacred warrior, transformed from his harrowing experience in the Nothl Realm. Huskar values vitality above all, and shares respect for heroes who do the same, such as  Bloodseeker and  Witch Doctor. He likens life to a holy chalice, spilled when a being dies.
Huskar's people appears to be based on the indigenous peoples of the New World. Deeply spiritual, they shun technology in favor of implements made from sacrificial bones, and sharpened stone, such as obsidian.
Coming from similar backgrounds, Huskar considers  Dazzle a cousin. Despite this, he resents him for bringing him back from the Nothl Realm.
