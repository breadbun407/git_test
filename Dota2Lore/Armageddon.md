Armageddon is  Chaos Knight's horse. No one knows where his hoofed friend came from and how the world brought the fate of these two together. But it is known for sure that he, along with his rider, exists in several worlds, leading an endless pursuit of the Keeper of the Light. It has the ability to ride between planes, to take its rider closer to his chosen targets. Chaos Knight himself seems to express some care or passion toward his mount.
