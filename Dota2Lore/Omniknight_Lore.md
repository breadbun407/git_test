Purist Thunderwrath the Omniknight is a zealous crusader for who fights for his god, the Omniscience. Outside of combat, Purist may also be a Hierophant, a member of the Omniscience's clergy. He is also a theologist, having knowledge on many gods outside of the one he worships.
Sensing a powerful and hidden evil stirring amongst the war between Stonehall and the Red Mist, Purist sought out Luna of the Dark Moon to form an alliance. With the combined might of their powers and their deities, he hopes to stop the Court of Ristul before their power begins to take influence on anyone.
