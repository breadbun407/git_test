Exort orb with Sol Apex
Exort orb of the young Invoker
A crystal containing pure Exort energy
Exort is one of the three arcane energies of the elements in the lore of Dota 2.
Fire is a light in the darkness, a perfect metaphor for knowledge and discovery. In the blackness, we raise our torches to anything that we need to see and through its flame the hidden things in the dark are revealed to us, whether they are worth knowing or a regrettable thing to be aware of. Flame is not just an element of light and knowledge, but also an element of might. Fire is often depicted as a merciless and brutal force, just like the flames of various religions and mythologies that possess purifying or destructive properties, and the relentless sun on a hot day which doesn't stop casting its vast light and heat for anyone.
Exort is an arcane energy that allows for the manipulation of fire elements, but it also includes the arcane manipulation of the sun's power. Exort also allows for the manipulation of properties with unrestrained force, fitting the high damage spells that use it. This energy may manifest as red crystals filled with its properties. Below is a list of Exort's properties.
Pugna claims that all sorceries have their source in the Nether Reaches. Aether (also known as void or nothingness) is an essential ingredient in the arcane arts, including Exort.
Along with the Invoker's signature Quas and Wex orbs, the elemental magic orb of Exort makes an appearance (and a few uses) in the animated series Dota: Dragon's Blood. According to this series' writer, producer, and creator Ashley Miller; this iteration of the Invoker doesn't mostly rely on the orbs to cast some of his spells. He compares this version of the Invoker's orbs to a "magical Swiss Army knife" (suggesting at their versatility) that empowers spells and allows him to cast magics that require these orbs.
As the sole, beloved offspring of the Invoker, Filomena inherits her father's sorcery, perhaps through his instruction. Hence, Filomena also wields the orbs of Quas, Wex, and Exort.
His Exort orb was first shown in the yellow-green pocket dimension that he trapped Fymryn in, appearing alongside his other orbs. They did not do much besides float around her. The hidden sage seemingly spoke to her through his orbs, but perhaps these orbs are him. When he chose to reveal himself, all three orbs flew up and converged on each other in a flash of magical light before his pocket dimension became sable. Just for a moment after his orbs converged and disappeared, his floating silhouette was briefly visible until it merged with his darkened dimension as quickly as it appeared, before he finally stepped out of the lightless space and appeared to her in the flesh.
All three orbs were orbiting him when the Invoker achieved astral projection to travel to Selemene's astral realm. Besides this, it's unknown if they did anything else in this process.
When the Invoker's Wex orb failed to capture Lirrak, he deployed his Exort orb which proved to be more potent than Wex in capturing Lirrak, albeit it cost him much of his life-force to perform the task of overpowering and capturing an Eldwurm.
The Invoker brought all three orbs with him when he confronted Vahdrak in his lair. It's unknown if he used any of them in the ensuing confrontation, since it wasn't shown.
In Foulfell, the Invoker confronted Terrorblade and his spectral army alone, invoking all three orbs for battle. He then reacts to the attack from the corrupted Eldwurms by fusing all of his orbs into a shield that protected him and his allies.
Filomena first demonstrates her inherited sorcery by sending out all three orbs to tear a Radiant Ore specimen from its crash site, somewhere in a snowy montane place. The elemental orbs levitated it into the air before forming a purple containment bubble around it for protection and transport.
While discussing Filomena's presentations about the Nemesis Stones to the Althing, her father expunged her research on them by burning her papers through his touch. He must have used the fire elements of Exort to perform this simple magic.
When the Invoker visited the Arc Warden in the Mad Moon, he was protected from the vacuum of space by a golden shield, and brought all three orbs with him, indicating that he was ready for any potential combat. During their fight, the Invoker attacked Zet with a handful of flames, the element of Exort.
Seeing that her father was in danger versus Zet, Filomena came to his rescue by using all three orbs to cast a teleportation spell that will bring her towards him to retrieve him.
Filomena prevented Bram, Davion, Marci, Mirana, Lina, and Luna from moving further into her home via trapping them inside a magical dome conjured with Exort, while Quas and Wex orbited the shield. But Mirana walked through it unimpeded with her divine powers, indicated by her eyes glowing bright yellow like the sun.
When Mirana mentions the Forge in the world before Experiment 12,403 to Filomena, who was discussing her plan with the Heroes to avert the upcoming cataclysm, Filomena fused all three orbs with the Archronicus to create a hologram of the current universe's version of the Forge that she can use to remotely control the true machine from.
The mental and mnemonic sorcery of  Invoke can be used to manipulate Exort energy. Spells invoked with Exort will inherit its elements and its properties.
Spells invoked by said mnemonic sorcery are also called hexes, incantations, and invocations, with no distinction between each of them.
The following is a comprehensive list of magical spells that use the fiery energies and ferocious properties of Exort.
Regardless, this spell brings the power of the "White Waste" to the battlefield, creating a slippery wall of ice that emanates an aura of debilitating cold.
The spell draws upon Quas for its ice and the bitter cold that it emits to slow nearby victims, while Exort may be the one that makes the ice wall's aura deal damage.
Alacrity (also known as Gaster's Mandate of Impetuous Strife or Zeal of Wexort) is an invocation of quickening and amplifying invoked by two  Wex and one  Exort.
A simple magic, this spell infuses the caster's target with an immense surge of energy that hastens their combat capabilities, hence the "Alacrity" name of the spell.
Wex provides the spell's ability to infuse others with its properties of zeal and swiftness, while Exort provides the spell's damage boost.
The magic thrived in the age of Gaster, when it gave mages a powerful option against well-armed adversaries who dared to attack them in close-quarters. Before the advent of the age of Gaster, mages in that situation would simply flee with a burst of defensive magic, implying that Alacrity allowed them to fight enemies head-on.
Sun Strike (also known as Harlek's Incantation of Incineration or Exort Tri-Solar) is a devastating solar incantation invoked with  Exort Trionis.
This spell channels a devastating ray of energy from the Sun towards the target location, incinerating anyone caught below the sun's concentrated ferocity.
It's implied that the spell has a vast cast range lorewise, so the sunray can be cast beyond the caster's sight. This allows for potential, blind trick shot kills.
Forged Spirits (a.k.a. Culween's Most Cunning Fabrications, Ravagers of Armor and Will, or Grief Elementals) are conjured by invoking two  Exort and one  Quas.





It seems that not all Forged Spirits look the same. This young Invoker's subservient elementals assume the shapes of fiery dragon hatchlings.
Despite their different appearance, the fiery dragon whelp is still a Forged Spirit in nature, meaning that it's still an elemental
spirit that is forged from naught. It's unknown why Forge Spirits may differ in appearance or what makes them take on different forms.
Regardless, this means that Forge Spirits do not have a constant form and may be shaped by unknown factors.
Chaos Meteor (also known as Tarak's Descent of Fire, Gallaron's Abyssal Carnesphere, or Voidal Pyroclasm) is a spell invoked with two  Exort and one  Wex.
This spell simply tears a flaming meteor from the void of outer space to send it crashing down to the targeted location, immolating and crushing anything in its path.
Exort deals with Chaos Meteor's damaging capabilities and its flames, while Wex deals with the aspects related to its motionâ€•maybe including its path across space and the earth.
Deafening Blast (also known as Buluphont's Aureal Incapacitator) is a spell that's invoked with one of each orb:  Quas,  Wex, and  Exort.
Using all three elements at once, this spell unleashes a mighty sonic wave that deafens those caught in its blast, leaving them reeling from the attack.
The magic essence of Exort has an influence on incubating  Greevils still in their eggs. Exort's influence manifests on the hatched Greevil which will inherit its violent properties.
The  Invoker wields this energies of Exort alongside Quas and Wex. Together with his art of invoking, he can weave spells that inherit Exort's power and properties together with his two other energies that he may use. These energies appear as the elemental spheres that orbit him, which amplifies the damage he deals if he has them active.
The young Invoker states that  Lina uses Exort, which may explain her flame and solar spells. Lina may have gotten it from her training in the flame arts with the Solar Goddess' acolytes and from her blessings from said deity.
The Burning Cabal specializes in and favors fire manipulation through Exort. Part of their uniform is a pair of enchanted bracers to protect against Exort's fire elements.
Exort is featured on Ultimyr Academy's insignia. This is related to the fact that Ultimyr once taught its students how to  Invoke, which is complementary with Quas, Wex, and Exort.
The eggs of  Greevils can be exposed to essences like Exort to influence the incubating hatchling. Once hatched, the Greevil babe will inherit Exort's violent properties.
Runes are forged of the most fundamental magic. It's unknown what this fundamental magic is, but the following info is speculation that divines what it may be.
