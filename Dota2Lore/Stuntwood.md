Stuntwood is a species of parasitic creeping vines that grow on trees, slowly sapping nutrients until its host dies. It produces sproutlings, animate young in the form of little humanoid creatures. Due to its destructive nature, the Fae consider stuntwood to be an invasive species, destroying the vines and the sproutlings on sight. Although deadly to most trees, stuntwood appear to live in harmony with Rooftrellen, and possibly other Treant Protectors.
