Bioluminescent vines are common in the Acid Jungles, and produce a sort of caustic sap which drip from its leaves. Epiphytes can be found on and around trees. Armored orchids also grow in the jungle, and produce nectar useful to apothecaries. The many plants of the Acid Jungle provide a wealth of pharmaceutical potential, and it is this reason that led Lesale to enter the jungles in the first place.
