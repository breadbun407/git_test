Gnomes are a race of people in the lore of Dota 2.
Little is known about them, but they are probably short like the typical gnomes that are depicted in fiction.
For unknown reasons, gnomes practice having charms: items that confer blessings or protection to the possessor.
The  Quelling Blade once belonged to a gnome, who has now passed into oblivion. But their axe lives on, which can be used to effectively maneuver through the woods.
The  Ring of Regen is considered a good luck charm among them.
