At some point in time, Rubick captured a mysterious puzzle named the Puzzle of Perplex in a special staff. He has spent his idle moments attempting to unlock this mysterious puzzle, but he could not solve it by himself. From time to time, he casts this puzzle on an enemy in hopes of gaining insight from their futile attempts to solve it as they hang enthralled by its mesmerizing mechanisms.
When Rubick discovered the crux of this puzzle, he found a "surprisingly simple" trick that would allow him to manipulate four-dimensional space to affect reality around him. But even after he did that, he realized that the knowledge at the heart of this puzzle would also allow him to alter the very foundations of magic itself. No longer reliant on the spellcasting of others, he now toys with the boundaries of arcane artistry, reshaping and revealing the unexplored world of magic to his liking.
Rubick is the son of Aghanim, the owner of the legendary  Aghanim's Scepter. He struggles to live up to his father's fame, living in the shadow cast by his accomplishments in the world of magic and has so far been unable to do so.
Pudge is Rubick's primary rival, the two having competed against one another in a contest long ago. Nevertheless, Pudge considers Rubick an "alright" guy, even though he finds him a bit strange.
