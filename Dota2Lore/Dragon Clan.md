The Dragon Clan is one of several ancestral clans, the others being the Bear Clan and the Serpent Clan. No records of their beliefs and practices exist. According to Sylla, Davion is a member of the Dragon Clan, although he may not know it.
It is possible that Sylla may have mistaken Davion's knighthood, the Scaled Knights of Uthorian, with Dragon Clan. Or perhaps they're one and the same.
