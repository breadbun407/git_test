The Undertree is a mysterious tree located in an unknown location. Like other trees, the Undertree grows buds.
It is the birthplace of Puck, who was hatched from a chrysalis on a frond of the Undertree, indicating a relationship with Faerie Dragons. Young Faerie Dragons who hatch on the Undertree proceed to nourish themselves by consuming the tree's roots, leaves, and stalks.
