Shadeshore is a seaside region of the world. Little is known of its beaches, except that carnivorous mangroves grow in its southern regions. The Shadeshore Ruins is located in Shadeshore, and is likely home to Meranths.
After escaping from Dark Reef, Slark now lives as a furtive inhabitant of southern Shadeshore, possibly known as Tidemarsh.
