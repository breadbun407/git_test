Vorn, the Dread Magus was a sorcerer who terrorized the native kingdom of  Phantom Lancer. The people of Pole, including Azwraith, were conscripted to fight against Vorn. Azwraith made his way into Vorn's tower sanctum, avoiding magical traps, and defeating Vorn's conjured guardians and nine royal guards. After a nightlong duel, Azwraith slew Vorn, who exploded into innumerable shards of light. The light saturated Azwraith's body, and gave him the power to blend with all spectrums of light.
Vorn's remaining essence was formed into a crystal, and used to craft a spear for Phantom Lancer.
