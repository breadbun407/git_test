Koryx is a character in the lore of Dota 2.
It's implied Koryx made or at least was involved in the creation of the  Ice Wall spell, since their possessive name is invoked when casting it. Thus, Koryx is possibly a mage.
Seeing how the young Invoker (who existed during the ancient times when spell-casting was once at its most potent form because it was still primarily a mnemonic art) learned this Ice Wall spell alongside his nine other invocations, Koryx must have existed during this golden age of magic as well and thus this obscure magician must've been an ancient one too.
In his youth, the  Invoker learned Koryx's  Ice Wall along with the other nine spells he currently wields, using two Quas orbs and one Exort orb to invoke this spell.
Having existed during the old ages when magic was primarily mnemonic, Koryx must've been quasi-immortal like the other ancient mages whom Invoker sourced his spells from.
Koryx must've been immortal, that is, assuming that this mage is still alive today like Gallaron...
Like the Invoker, Koryx might have the power to  Invoke spells using the energies of  Quas and  Exort. Otherwise, they can't cast or even have their  Ice Wall spell (also known as Killing Wall of Koryx or Bitter Rampart) which requires two Quas orbs and one Exort orb to invoke. However, young Invoker says he calls upon ice and storm instead.
A simple elemental spell, this invocation generates a slippery wall of solid ice that not only blocks paths, but also emanates a bitter cold that chills and slows nearby victims.
Upon casting this spell, the Invoker may mention the beckoning of a harshly cold place called the “White Waste” for some reason. This interesting line may imply the following:
