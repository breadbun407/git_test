The Shopkeeper is a major character in the animated series of Dota: Dragon's Blood.
The Shopkeeper returns in the animated series DOTA: Dragon's Blood. His brief encounter with the heroes of the story belies his vast influence on their stories.
After having his location tipped off by Gwanwyn, Mirana and Marci sought out the Shopkeeper to help them recover the stolen lotuses. They arrive at his shop, and Mirana inquires him about the location of the stolen lotuses. He responds, assuring them that he has no business dealing with stolen goods. Adding to his answer, he also says that he knows a person who might help them: a lone sage who lives in his tower, residing in a valley south of the Broken Peaks. He then offers the Shopkeeper's Gem, and says that they will need it to "see" him.
Mirana offers him a bracelet in exchange, but he declines, saying that he would rather be repaid in kind. Before the scene ends, he holds up the gem to reveal Mirana's past in its facets, while confirming their bargain.
He is not seen again after this, but later episodes reveal that his actions of giving away the gem was indirectly responsible for Terrorblade's temporary manifestation on the material plane, and one of the key factors to Nightsilver's fall at the hands of Terrorblade and the Coedwen elves.
