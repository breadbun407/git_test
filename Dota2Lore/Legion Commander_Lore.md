Led by Tresdin, the Bronze Legion attempted to hold off the Red Mist army at Roseleaf. Details are scarce, save for hints that Tresdin made poor decisions and may have initiated the fight, resulting in disaster for the Bronze Legion. After the battle, the Bullsnake Flag was found at the site by Mireska, which is the legion's emblem.
Tresdin was once in love with a man named Belasanno.
