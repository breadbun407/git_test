Throsho was a shapeshifting sorcerer. Taking the form of a demon, he intimidated those living in his realm into worshipping him. He was eccentric, wearing strange armor made to fit his shifting form. Throsho's forms were said to be so frightening, that it shattered the minds of any witnesses.
He was slain by  Anti-Mage, who wore a cloth over his eyes to avoid looking at Throsho's terrifying appearance. After his death, Anti-Mage claimed some of the sorcerer's armor for himself.
