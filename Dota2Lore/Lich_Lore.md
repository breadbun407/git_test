Lich was involved in the war raging in Roseleaf. He is technically not a direct participant, but he sees it as an embarrassment of riches, as the war has many opportunities for him to take while it goes on: Lion travels to Weeping Rose, seeking asylum in the city to protect himself from the Tyler Estate and the Court of Ristul. Crystal Maiden is on holiday, who may be residing somewhere within Weeping Rose due to her duties as an external collaborator with the Sapphire Conclave. And the Vhoul rebellion, led by the rebel Rix, is currently losing against Stonehall's forces and are willing to do anything to win the fight. With all these events, Lich sizes up his options: who should he kill first?
