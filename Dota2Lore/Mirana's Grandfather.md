Mirana's Grandfather was a character exclusive to the series Dota: Dragon's Blood.
Little is known about him, besides having left behind a sword. This sword is on display in the Helio Imperium's palace alongside a set of armor and a shield.
Besides his granddaughter Mirana, his son and daughter may be Zal and Sherzi, if both of them didn't come from two different families.
