The Black King Bar is a powerful anti-magic item in the lore of Dota 2.
The strength of giants and the power to defy all magic imbues this powerful staff, yet its power lessens with each use. It once belonged to the long gone Black King.
The staff's Black King was inimical with  Dawnbreaker, who calls them a wretched sort of being.
Most, if not all, sorts of powerful divinities wield and make use of the renowned Black King Bar.
