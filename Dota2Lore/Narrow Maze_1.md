The Narrow Maze is a complex system of twisted passageways that newly deceased souls must navigate before reaching the Underscape. In doing so, the Narrow Maze sorts souls based on their intelligence, cunning, and persistence. Some souls exit into points of light, while others exit into dark pits. The walls of the Narrow Maze are lined with sharpened blades. A few blessed individuals have returned to life from the Narrow Maze, although how exactly is unknown.
