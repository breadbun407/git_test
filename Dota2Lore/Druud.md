Oglodi
Druud is a land in the Dota 2 world. It is characterized as a highland or plateau, and is home to the centaur clans. The arena of Omexe is located in Druud.
Upland Druud is also home to a group of Oglodi, who are all that remains of an ancient tribe. Upland Oglodi are often besieged by kingdoms to the south of Druud.
Stryders can be found in upland Druud, and are used as a mount by the Oglodi.
