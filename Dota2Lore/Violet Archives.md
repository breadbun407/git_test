The Violet Archives was a recordkeeping place inside or near the Violet Plateau. It kept logs of scientific experiments performed by the Keen personnel. The archives were partially destroyed after the Violet Plateau Incident. Lanaya visited its ruins later on, memorizing what remained of its records.
One weapons blueprint in the archives showed a focal device that concentrated the wearer's psychic energies into a blast of piercing energy. This schema was eventually used to craft a weapon for  Templar Assassin, who probably discovered it. Some believe blueprints such as this are better off remaining lost.
