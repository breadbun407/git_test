The Claddish Navy is a powerful fleet operating out of the island nation of Cladd. It was headed by its admiral,  Kunkka, who was tasked with defending his homeland. The colors of the Claddish Navy are blue and gold. Claddish sailors are armed with sabres and flintlock pistols. Ships are manned by cannon crews, led by a special captain, who wears a plumed helmet. Distinguished veterans are given a seal of honor, made in the shape of a falcon.
During the battle at the Trembling Isle, the Claddish Navy faced off against the Demons of the Cataract, with the help of ancestral spirits summoned by the Suicide-Mages. Nevertheless, both fleets were destroyed by Maelrawn, leaving behind only one ghostly ship still commanded by Kunkka.  Tidehunter later stumbled upon the sunken fleet, and claimed the flag ship's mast as a weapon.
